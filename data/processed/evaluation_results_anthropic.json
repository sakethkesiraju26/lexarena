Civil penalties for negligent violations under Securities Act 17(a)(2) and (3) are typically less severe than fraud penalties - likely around $100,000. The other defendants collectively earned 'millions' in commissions from $18M in sales, suggesting similar disgorgement amounts. Prejudgment interest is standard but modest given the recent timeframe (2020-2021).\",\n    \"remedial_measures\": \"Injunctions are standard in SEC settlements. No officer/director bar is likely since these defendants weren't corporate officers. However, conduct restrictions are probable given the broker-dealer registration violations - they'll likely be barred from acting as unregistered brokers and possibly from association with broker-dealers.\"\n  }\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "Looking at this SEC complaint, I need to analyze the likely outcomes for the ongoing litigation. The complaint indicates that while several defendants have already reached final judgments, the litigation \"remains ongoing against other defendants.\"\n\nBased on the patterns shown in the already-resolved cases and the nature of the allegations, here's my prediction:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"resolution_type\": \"settled\",\n  \"disgorgement_amount\": 500000,\n  \"penalty_amount\": 250000,\n  \"prejudgment_interest\": 15000,\n  \"has_injunction\": true,\n  \"has_officer_director_bar\": false,\n  \"has_conduct_restriction\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"resolution_type\": \"The complaint shows that 6 defendants have already settled through consent judgments or default judgments. This pattern strongly suggests remaining defendants will also settle rather than litigate. SEC penny stock fraud cases typically settle, especially when co-defendants have already done so.\",\n    \"monetary\": \"Kauderer, a middleman promoter, paid $888,012 in disgorgement. The remaining defendants likely played lesser roles, suggesting lower amounts. I estimate $500,000 in disgorgement based on typical amounts for secondary participants in $11M schemes. The penalty of $250,000 reflects that Kauderer received no penalty due to cooperation, but remaining defendants likely won't have that benefit. Prejudgment interest typically runs 2-3% of disgorgement.\",\n    \"remedial_measures\": \"All resolved defendants received permanent injunctions against future securities violations - this is standard SEC practice and will certainly apply to remaining defendants. A penny stock bar is likely given this is a penny stock fraud scheme and Kauderer received a 5-year bar. Officer/director bars are less likely as these appear to be promoters/facilitators rather than corporate officers.\"\n  }\n}\n```",

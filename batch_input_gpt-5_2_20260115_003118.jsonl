Artur Khachatryan, No. 25-cv-11863 (C.D. Cal. filed Dec. 16, 2025)SEC Files Settled Action as to Southern California Resident in Alleged Manipulative Spoofing SchemeOn December 16, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed settled charges as to Artur Khachatryan, a resident of Tujunga, California, for allegedly conducting a manipulative stock trading scheme known as spoofing over a two-year period and generating approximately $373,885 in ill-gotten gains.According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Khachatryan\u2019s scheme involved placing orders for stock that he did not intend to execute \u2013 otherwise known as spoof orders. The complaint alleges that he placed these orders outside of regular market hours when the stocks were thinly traded and the prices were easier to manipulate.\u00a0 According to the complaint, as part of his alleged scheme, Khachatryan would rapidly place a series of spoof orders on one side of the market for a particular stock, which artificially moved the stock price in a direction of his choosing.\u00a0 The complaint further alleges that he then would place and execute orders on the opposite side of the market to take advantage of the price movement he had created, before quickly canceling his spoof orders.\u00a0Khachatryan then allegedly repeated the same spoofing scheme on the other side of the market to move the stock price in the opposite direction and lock in his profits from trading at manipulated prices.\u00a0 The SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that after multiple broker-dealers restricted trading in or closed Khachatryan\u2019s accounts, he opened brokerage accounts in the names of other individuals to continue his manipulative trading.The SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, charges Khachatryan with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\u00a0The complaint also charges Khachatryan with violating Section 9(a)(2) of the Exchange Act.\u00a0 Khachatryan, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, has consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, imposing permanent injunctive relief for the charged provisions and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $373,885 plus prejudgment interest of $22,629.34, and a civil penalty of $112,165.\u00a0 The final judgment would also prohibit Khachatryan, for a period of four years, from, directly or indirectly, opening, maintaining or trading in any brokerage account(s) in his name, the names of any immediate family members, the name of any company over which he has any control, or the name(s) of any third party individuals, without providing the relevant broker-dealer(s) a copy of the final judgment entered against him.The SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Sara Kalin and Matthew Koop of the Market Abuse Unit, and was supervised by Assistant Director Diana Tani and Market Abuse Unit Chief Joseph Sansone.\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

As alleged, Ward falsely told investors that Apex Financial: (i) was regulated by the SEC; (ii) had $25 million in assets under management; (iii) had successfully conducted a 12-month beta test of its trading strategies; (iv) employed trading strategies that offered investors the opportunity to experience substantial gains without any risk of loss; and (v) had several international offices.Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Ward previously consented to an order, entered by the Court on May 19, 2025, that permanently enjoined him from (a) violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (b) trading securities, except for securities listed on a national securities exchange in his own personal accounts; and (c) serving as an officer or director of a public company.

Ill. filed Dec. 12, 2025)SEC Files Settled Action Against Irfan Mohammed for Alleged Offering FraudOn December 12, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled action against Peoria, Illinois resident Irfan Mohammed, alleging that he engaged in a fraudulent scheme through which he obtained approximately $585,000 from members of the Islamic community in Central Illinois. Irfan Mohammed consented to the entry of a judgment without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations.According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from at least January 2021 through March 2023, Irfan Mohammed received investments based on false representations to investors that his company, Dgtal World LLC, had successful operations offering a payment processing system overseas and that he was expanding these services to companies in the United States. In fact, according to the complaint, Dgtal World had no operations, and Irfan Mohammed misappropriated investor funds for an unrelated business and to pay for his personal expenses. As alleged, Irfan Mohammed lulled investors into thinking their investments were generating a return by using investor funds to make sham payments to investors, including at least one Ponzi payment.The SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, charges Irfan Mohammed with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Irfan Mohammed agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges. The settlement, which will be filed with the court and is subject to the court\u2019s approval, would permanently enjoin Irfan Mohammed from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, impose a conduct-based injunction enjoining him from the issuance, offer, purchase or sale of securities outside of trading through his personal account, and order him to pay disgorgement of $385,220 with prejudgment interest of $70,640, and a civil penalty of $70,000.The SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Liz Marshall Anderson and Matthew B.

Oliver, California-based David P. Ortiz and his entity, DaveGlo Investment Group, Inc., and Kevin N. Richards, formerly of Laguna Niguel, California, with selling securities in unregistered offerings of oil and gas securities, acting as unregistered brokers, and failing to disclose financial conflicts of interest to clients.The SEC\u2019s complaints alleged that from at least 2020 through 2021, defendants marketed and sold investments in risky oil and gas securities to clients, many of whom lost their money.The SEC\u2019s complaint against Oliver alleged that\u00a0Oliver, a Florida-based insurance agent, marketed and sold approximately $52\u00a0million of investments in oil and gas securities to approximately 50\u00a0retail investors. The complaint alleged that Oliver used his radio show, Hidden Wealth Radio, to solicit investors, and that he received over $4.3 million in transaction-based compensation for selling the unregistered securities.The SEC\u2019s complaint against Ortiz and DaveGlo alleged that\u00a0Ortiz, a California resident, marketed and sold approximately $18\u00a0million of investments in oil and gas securities to approximately 20\u00a0retail investors. The complaint alleged that Ortiz used mass marketing, including commercials on radio broadcasts, to solicit investors, and that he received over $800,000 in transaction-based compensation for selling the unregistered securities.The SEC\u2019s complaint against Richards alleged that\u00a0Richards, a former California-based insurance agent, marketed and sold approximately $12\u00a0million of investments in oil and gas securities to approximately 25\u00a0retail investors.

The SEC\u2019s complaint against Ortiz and DaveGlo and its complaint against Richards were filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The companies that sponsored the unregistered offerings of oil and gas securities, and their principals, were the subject of a prior SEC enforcement action, In the Matter of Resolute Capital Partners, LTD, LLC, et al., AP File No. 3\u201120597 (Sept. 24, 2021).The complaints separately charged Oliver, Ortiz, DaveGlo, and Richards with violating\u00a0Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Oliver, Ortiz, and Richards were also charged with violating Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the allegations in their respective complaints, Ortiz, DaveGlo, and Richards each consented to the entry of a judgment enjoining them from violating the charged provisions; as to Ortiz and Richards, enjoining them from offering or selling securities; and as to Richards, enjoining him from acting as or associating with a broker, dealer, or investment adviser for five years.

Tiffany Kelly and Curastory Inc., No. 25-civ-6876 (E.D.N.Y. filed Dec. 15, 2025)SEC Files Settled Action as to Curastory Inc. and CEO Tiffany Kelly for Alleged Offering FraudOn December 15, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled action as to\u00a0 Brooklyn-based Curastory Inc. and its founder and CEO, Tiffany Kelly, alleging that they engaged in an offering fraud in which they raised approximately $2.8 million from over 1,000 investors nationwide.\u00a0 Curastory and Kelly consented to the entry of a judgment without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations.According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from at least December 2020 through February 2024, Curastory and Kelly repeatedly misled investors about Curastory\u2019s revenue and projected financial performance, often telling investors that the company had earned hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars in revenue, when it had actually generated little revenue during that period. The complaint further alleges that Kelly falsely told investors that Curastory had secured or lined up million-dollar investments, when it had not done so. Notably, the complaint also alleges that Kelly forged the signature of a prospective investor as part of a fraudulent scheme to depict Curastory as a successful and profitable company.The SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charges Kelly and Curastory with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, defendants have agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges, consenting to permanent injunctive relief for the charged provisions. Kelly has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $125,000 and consented to a ten-year conduct-based injunction, prohibiting her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, except for her own personal accounts, and a ten-year bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

Kevin L. Jefferson, No. 3:25-cv-02635-L (N.D. Tex. filed Sept. 29, 2025); Securities and Exchange Commission v. Demetrius L. Early, No. 4:25-cv-4622 (S.D. Tex. filed Sept. 29, 2025)SEC Obtains Final Consent Judgments as to Texas Residents Regarding $1 Million Offering that Targeted African American CommunityOn November 21, 2025, U.S. District Courts for the Northern District of Texas and the Southern District of Texas respectively entered final consent judgments in the SEC\u2019s civil enforcement actions against Texas residents, Kevin L. Jefferson and Demetrius L. Early. Jefferson and Early consented to the entry of the judgments without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations and have agreed to pay a total of more than $1.1 million to settle charges that Jefferson, with Early\u2019s assistance, raised over $1,000,000 from more than 65 investors through a fraudulent offering of unregistered securities, targeting members of the African American community in the greater Shreveport, Louisiana, and Dallas and Houston, Texas metropolitan areas and elsewhere.The SEC\u2019s complaints, filed on September 29, 2025, alleged that from at least January 2023 through December 2023, Jefferson and Early, one of Jefferson\u2019s primary sales agents, solicited investors to purchase membership interests in Jefferson\u2019s Cashflow Creation Club, telling them Jefferson would make foreign currency exchange (\u201cForex\u201d) trades on their behalf. Allegedly, Jefferson promoted himself as an expert Forex trader and represented to investors that they would earn 3 to 5% monthly returns of approximately $6,000 per month, and that they should expect to grow those monthly returns up to approximately $83,000 by the end of the year.\u00a0 The complaints alleged that instead, Jefferson used approximately $170,000 of investor funds towards purported investment-related expenses, misappropriating nearly 85% of investor funds to pay undisclosed sales commissions to Early (and others) and for his personal expenses.Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jefferson and Early consented to the entry of final judgments, which permanently enjoined them from violating the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and enjoined Jefferson from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgments also ordered Jefferson to pay $580,913 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $35,490, and a\u00a0$236,451 civil penalty, and ordered Early to pay $205,267 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $22,529, and a\u00a0$75,000 civil penalty. The final judgments additionally prohibit Jefferson and Early from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities (with the exception of trading in their personal accounts) and acting as or being associated with any broker or dealer.The SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Dan Cristol and Mark Dee and supervised by Jason R. Berkowitz, Fernando Torres, and Glenn S. Gordon of the SEC\u2019s Miami Regional Office.\u00a0 The SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Pascale Guerrier and supervised by Teresa J.

Melton and his limited-liability company, Integrated Consulting & Management, LLC, in connection with charges related to a fraudulent securities offering.The SEC\u2019s\u00a0complaint, filed on May 30, 2023 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, Greensboro Division, alleged that the defendants raised between approximately $1.03 and $1.49 million from seven investors, six of whom had an average age of 75 when they first invested.\u00a0 The SEC alleged that Melton told investors that he would use their funds to buy and renovate properties in downtown Laurinburg, North Carolina, to generate rental income and resale proceeds and provide returns for investors. The complaint, however, alleged that Melton\u2019s representations were false, that he never paid the investors their promised returns or returned to their invested amounts, and that Melton misappropriated nearly two-thirds of investor funds for his own use.On April 17, 2025, the Court awarded summary judgment in favor of the SEC on all three of its liability claims, finding that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. See\u00a0Litigation Release No. 26292 (Apr. 24, 2025).The final judgment permanently enjoins the defendants from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and permanently enjoins Melton from participating in the issuance, offer, purchase, or sale of any securities, including any security related to interests in real estate, unless the security is either listed on a national securities exchange or traded through an established over-the-counter market and the trade occurs in Melton\u2019s personal accounts. The final judgment also orders the defendants, jointly and severally, to pay disgorgement of $916,341 and pre-judgment interest of $312,460.84, and orders Melton to pay a civil penalty of $472,902.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Regarding Alleged Failure to Comply with Municipal Bond Offering Disclosure RequirementsOn December 10, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final consent judgment in the SEC\u2019s\u00a0civil enforcement action against New York-based Oppenheimer & Co. Inc..According to the SEC\u2019s\u00a0complaint, from June 2017 to April 2022, Oppenheimer sold the relevant municipal bonds in purported reliance on the \u201climited offering exemption,\u201d which, upon satisfying specific requirements, exempts certain municipal securities offerings from the general requirement of providing disclosures to investors. The complaint alleged that Oppenheimer sold securities in hundreds of municipal offerings in purported reliance on the limited offering exemption when it had not satisfied the exemption requirements. The complaint also alleged that Oppenheimer made\u00a0deceptive statements to issuers by representing that it would and did comply with the exemption requirements, and that Oppenheimer lacked policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that it complied with the limited offering exemption when acting as underwriter in these municipal bond offerings.Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Oppenheimer consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) Rules G-17 and G-27, and Exchange Act Section 15B(c)1.

According to the SEC's complaint, San Miguel lured investors with false and misleading claims of a 12% annual dividend, escalating revenue and profits, and a $19 million account receivable on SGR Energy\u2019s balance sheet.

Thomas Weisel Partners LLC,\u00a0No. 04 Civ. 6910 (S.D.N.Y.)SEC Consents to Termination of Undertakings in Global Research Analyst SettlementThe Securities and Exchange Commission today consented to modifications to the\u00a0October 2003 and\u00a0September 2004 final judgments against settling firms still covered by the Global Research Analyst Settlement, a global settlement of SEC and other enforcement actions against twelve investment banks and two individuals. The modifications are subject to court approval.The final judgments contained an Addendum with undertakings that addressed potential conflicts of interest between equity research analysts and investment banking personnel. The Addendum also included a sunset provision for newly adopted rules that would supersede the undertakings, and stated that for terms that were not superseded, the SEC would agree to an amendment or modification, subject to court approval, unless the SEC believed the amendment or modification would not be in the public interest.\u00a0The Addendum was modified by court order in March 2010 to remove or modify certain provisions. The revised Addendum also stated that the SEC would agree to further amendment or modification of the undertakings, subject to court approval, unless the SEC believed the amendment or modification would not be in the public interest.In 2015, FINRA adopted and implemented, and the SEC approved, Rule 2241 (Research Analysts and Research Reports), which addresses conflicts of interest between research analysts and investment banking personnel within registered broker-dealers.The settling firms filed motions in June and December 2025 seeking to terminate the remaining undertakings in the Addendum based in part on the adoption and implementation of FINRA Rule 2241. In its responses to the motions, the SEC acknowledges the sunset provision in Addendum A of the final judgments and the passage of FINRA Rule 2241, states that it \u201cbelieves modification of the Judgment is in the public interest,\u201d and consents to the requested modification of the final judgments.\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Notice - Bear Stearns\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Notice - JP Morgan\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Notice - Lehman Brothers, Inc\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Notice - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc.\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Notice - Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc.\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Notice- UBC Securities f/k/a UBS Warberg LLC\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Notice - Goldman, Sachs & Co.\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Notice - Citigroup Global Markets Inc., f/k/a Salomon Smith Barney,\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Notice - Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, f/k/a Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Notice - Morgan Stanley& Co.

Shahin Ahmed, Civil Action No. 1:25-cv-06730 (E.D.N.Y. filed Dec. 5, 2025)SEC Charges New York Man with Defrauding Clients by Posing as a Professional Money ManagerOn December 5, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Shahin Ahmed, the personal driver of a hedge fund manager for posing as an investment professional to convince three investors to let him manage their money, resulting in their combined losses of over $1 million.The SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleges that from at least March 2020 to February 2022, Ahmed persuaded prospective clients that he had experience as a professional money manager at a hedge fund when, in fact, he was employed as the personal driver for a hedge fund manager, without any of the education or professional experience he claimed to have. As set forth in the complaint, Ahmed led at least one client to believe his funds would be expertly invested by the hedge fund manager for whom he drove, and presented the client with a fake investment opportunity and false reports of high returns. As alleged, Ahmed further induced that individual and a married couple to give him access to their own brokerage accounts to trade securities in those accounts. Ahmed allegedly guaranteed risk-free investment, while fraudulently collecting fees from his clients. The complaint further alleges that, contrary to his promised guarantee, Ahmed never repaid any of the trading losses that he caused.Ahmed consented to a bifurcated settlement, subject to court approval, which provides for permanent injunctive relief against future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The judgment also bars Ahmed from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, other than purchasing or selling securities for his own personal accounts, and bars Ahmed from acting as or being associated with an investment adviser. The judgment further authorizes the court to determine at a later date the appropriateness and amount of any disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalty.On June 24, 2025, the Nassau County (New York) District Attorney's Office arraigned Ahmed on a grand larceny charge with respect to his conduct with one of his clients.The SEC's investigation was conducted by Brenda Wai Ming Chang, Neil Hendelman and Adam S.

The SEC previously charged Gregoire P. Tournant (Tournant), Trevor L. Taylor (Taylor), and Stephen G. Bond-Nelson (Bond-Nelson) with a massive fraudulent scheme that concealed the significant downside risks of a complex options trading strategy called \u201cStructured Alpha.\u201dAccording to the\u00a0SEC\u2019s complaint, Structured Alpha\u2019s Lead Portfolio Manager, Tournant, orchestrated the multi-year scheme to mislead investors who invested approximately $11 billion in Structured Alpha and paid over $550 million in fees. It further alleges that, with assistance from Co-Lead Portfolio Manager, Taylor, and Portfolio Manager, Bond-Nelson, Tournant manipulated numerous financial reports and other information provided to investors to conceal the magnitude of Structured Alpha\u2019s risk and performance.In parallel criminal proceedings, Tournant was sentenced to: (i) three years of probation; (ii) 18 months of home incarceration; (iii) a fine of $250,000; and (iv) forfeiture of $17,577,908. Taylor was sentenced to: (1) three years of probation; (ii) a fine of $4,000; and (iii) forfeiture of $13,460,708. Bond-Nelson was sentenced to: (i) three years of probation; (ii) three months of home confinement; (iii) a fine of $4,000; and (iv) forfeiture of $1,610,465.Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Tournant consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder and ordering a permanent industry bar.

James R. Collins and Robert F. DiMeo, Civil Action 1:21-cv-05040 (N.D. Ill. filed Sept. 23, 2021)SEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Principals of Subprime Automobile Finance Company Charged with FraudOn December 3, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained final judgment against James R. Collins and Robert F. DiMeo, two former executives of a subprime automobile finance company, whom the SEC previously charged with misleading investors about the subprime automobile loans that backed the company\u2019s $100 million securities offering.The SEC's complaint alleged that Collins and DiMeo were responsible for false and misleading statements about, and engaged in deceptive conduct regarding, Honor Finance, LLC's servicing practices in connection with the Honor Automobile Trust Securitization 2016-1 (HATS). According to the SEC's complaint, Collins and DiMeo took various steps designed to artificially inflate the value of the collateral underlying HATS. Specifically, the complaint alleged that Collins and DiMeo were responsible for, among other things, including loans in the deal that were not eligible to be included in the securitization vehicle, extending loan repayment dates without borrower knowledge, and forgiving payments due from delinquent borrowers. The complaint further alleged that, because of these improper practices, the servicing and performance information Honor provided to investors at the time of the offering and in later monthly reports was false.The final judgment, entered in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, incorporates injunctive relief Collins and DiMeo previously consented to, including permanently enjoining them from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well permanently prohibiting them from acting as officers or directors of a public company. The final judgement further orders Collins to pay disgorgement in the amount of $450,000 plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $100,332, for a total of $550,332. DiMeo is ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $162,500 plus prejudgment interest thereon on in the amount of $36,231, for a total of $198,731. The disgorgement and prejudgment interest amounts against both defendants are deemed satisfied by the restitution order entered against them in a criminal case filed against them under United States v. Collins et al., 20-cr-232 (N.D. Ill. May 23, 2020).In the criminal case, the Court ordered Collins and DiMeo to jointly pay $67,243,790.94 in restitution, a portion of which was attributable to the conduct alleged in the SEC\u2019s case. Collins was also sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 48 months, while DiMeo was sentenced to one day of imprisonment and 12 months of supervised release.This SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Jason Anthony and supervised by Paul Pashkoff.

Yida Gao and Shima Capital Management LLC, No. 3:25-cv-10200-SK (N.D. Cal. filed Nov. 25, 2025)SEC Charges Investment Adviser and its Owner With Making False and Misleading StatementsOn November 25, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed fraud charges against Puerto Rico-based registered investment adviser Shima Capital Management LLC and its owner, Georgia resident Yida Gao, for making false and misleading statements in raising more than $169.9 million from two sets of investors.According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from at least May 2021 through March 2023, Gao and Shima Capital raised more than $158 million from 349 investors by offering and selling membership interests in a crypto-asset-focused venture fund called Shima Capital Fund I, using a marketing pitch deck that contained material misrepresentations about Gao\u2019s investment track record. The pitch deck claimed, for example, that one of Gao\u2019s prior investments had generated a 90 times return, when he actually earned a 2.8 times return, as alleged. The complaint further alleges that, when he learned that a news article was about to be published about apparent discrepancies in the pitch deck, Gao called several investors and falsely told them that the discrepancies arose from mere clerical errors.In addition, the SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that, in April and May 2021, Gao raised approximately $11.9 million from five investors by offering and selling membership interests in a special purpose vehicle called the \u201cBitClout SPV.\u201d According to the complaint, Gao claimed that he could purchase BitClout tokens at a 20\u201340% discount, and that this substantial discount would protect investors\u2019 investments, even if the price of BitClout tokens later dropped. The complaint alleges that, while Gao did purchase BitClout tokens at a substantial discount, he sold them to the BitClout SPV for a higher price, without disclosing to investors that he kept $1.9 million in profit for himself.The SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, charges Gao and Shima Capital with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. Gao consented to a bifurcated settlement permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions; ordering him to pay disgorgement of $3,923,757.33, with prejudgment interest of $304,622.67 (to be offset by any restitution ordered in United States v. Yida Gao (N.D. Cal.)); and ordering a conduct-based injunction, officer-and-director bar, and penalties to be resolved upon a motion by the SEC. Shima Capital consented to a settlement permanently enjoining it from future violations of the charged provisions and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings. The settlements are subject to court approval.The SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Colin Missett, Amy Harman Burkart, Joy Guo, and Kerry Vasta, under the supervision of Celia Moore of the SEC\u2019s Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Burkart. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California, which unsealed a parallel criminal action against Gao on November 25, 2025, and the FBI.\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Andrew Scott Corbman, No. 1:25-cv-01630 (E.D. Va. filed Sept. 29, 2025)SEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Former Registered Representative and Investment Adviser for Conducting a $4.15 Million Fraudulent SchemeOn October 3, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment [LINK] against Andrew Scott Corbman, a Virginia-based former registered representative with several broker-dealers registered with the Commission and investment adviser representative, who was charged with conducting a $4.15 million fraudulent scheme.According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from 2019 through 2023, Corbman convinced multiple investors, including retired military officers and a retired federal civil servant, to purchase more than $4 million of securities in the form of \u201cLoan Agreements\u201d by making false and misleading statements about his investment track record, the riskiness of the investments, and the use of investor funds.\u00a0 The complaint alleges that Corbman misrepresented to investors that his past investments generated substantial returns when, in fact, his trading losses exceeded $3 million.The Complaint further alleges that while touting his purported professional accomplishments, Corbman failed to inform investors that he had previously filed for personal bankruptcy, had a lengthy Financial Industry Regulatory Authority disciplinary history culminating in fines and disbarment, and lost his Virginia insurance business license following an investigation by state regulators.\u00a0 Further, rather than investing funds as promised, Corbman allegedly misused investors\u2019 funds by engaging primarily in extremely high-risk trading and misappropriating funds to pay his own personal expenses including, among other things, payments of back taxes and credit card debt, and attorney fees for lawyers who represented him in bankruptcy proceedings.Corbman consented to the entry of the final judgment which permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from acting as or being associated with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser.\u00a0 The final judgment also ordered him to pay disgorgement in the amount of $4.15 million, with such amount deemed satisfied by a restitution order in a parallel criminal case, United States v. Corbman, No. 1:24-cr-00255 (E.D. Va.).The SEC's investigation was conducted by\u00a0Jennifer Miller, under the supervision of Kingdon Kase and Scott A.

Virtu Americas consented to entry of the judgment without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations.The SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on September 12, 2023 (and amended January 12, 2024), alleged that Virtu Americas operated both a proprietary trading business, in which it bought and sold securities in its own account and for its benefit, as well as a trade execution business for its large institutional customers, whereby it executed customer orders. The complaint alleged that from at least January 2018 through April 2019, Virtu Americas failed to establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that its proprietary traders could not access material nonpublic information of Virtu Americas\u2019 customer orders \u2013 including, among other things, the customer name, the security name, the side (buy or sell), and the execution price and volume \u2013 maintained in a primary database for daily business operations and a backup database.\u00a0Without admitting or denying the Commission\u2019s allegations against it, Virtu Americas consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and orders it to pay a civil monetary penalty of $2.5 million.

Andrew Wyles Waters, No. 2:23-cv-06799-GW-JCx (filed Aug. 18, 2023) (C.D. Cal.)SEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Former California and Colorado Resident in Fraudulent Stock SchemeOn October 16, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Andrew Wyles Waters, whom the SEC charged in 2023 with perpetrating a fraudulent scheme involving his private sale of restricted common stock in ECom Products Group Corporation (OTC: EPGC) (now known as Zippeee Corp), a Florida corporation that purportedly owns, consolidates, and manages e-commerce platforms.The SEC's complaint alleged that, from late 2019 to July 2022, Waters fraudulently induced more than 20 investors to purchase EPGC common stock from him and fraudulently caused 12 investors to accept EPGC common stock in exchange for the stock of another company Waters owned and controlled. According to the complaint, the EPGC common stock that Waters sold to investors (both in direct sales and the exchange of shares) had a total face value of approximately $3 million. The complaint alleged that Waters, who served as EPGC's Director and CEO, made repeated false and misleading statements to investors about EPGC's business and purported Regulation A offering, as well as his intended use of the funds he obtained from his sales of the stock. According to the complaint, Waters and his wife, relief defendant Helen Q. Waters, used cash proceeds from Waters' fraud for personal expenses - including expenses associated with horseback riding and long-term luxury home rentals.The Court\u2019s final judgment by default permanently enjoins Waters from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security in an unregistered transaction, and from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The final judgment also imposes a permanent officer-and-director bar and a permanent penny stock bar against Waters. In addition, the Court ordered Waters to pay, on an individual basis, disgorgement of $1,939,426.48, prejudgment interest of $600,149.94, and a civil penalty of $236,451.00; relief defendant Helen Waters to pay, on an individual basis, disgorgement of $6,300.00 and prejudgment interest of $1,322.67; and Waters and relief defendant Helen Waters to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $446,565.27 and prejudgment interest of $93,754.88.The SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by Timothy Leiman, Jake Schmidt, Taryn Lewis, Joshua Wagoner, and Brian Fagel of the SEC\u2019s Chicago Regional Office.\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Santarelli, a resident of Laguna Niguel, California for running a multi-million-dollar investment scheme that defrauded hundreds of investors nationwide. \u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleges that, from at least June 2020 to June 2024, Santarelli, through his company Norada Capital Management, LLC, raised tens of millions of dollars through the sale of unsecured, high-yield promissory notes that Santarelli falsely described as having \u201cstrong capital preservation potential.\u201d \u00a0In reality, Norada\u2019s investments were volatile and speculative, and by August 2023, the SEC alleges that Santarelli and Norada could no longer satisfy the returns they had promised to investors, and began making Ponzi-like payments in which investor returns were paid using funds obtained from new investors. \u00a0The SEC alleges that in June 2024, Santarelli notified investors that Norada was suspending distribution payments to investors, and ceased operations by early 2025.\u00a0\n\nSantarelli, without denying the allegations contained in the SEC\u2019s complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the antifraud and registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, imposing a conduct-based injunction, and ordering him to pay a penalty, disgorgement and prejudgment interest with amounts to be determined upon motion of the SEC.\n\nIn a parallel action, Santarelli pled guilty to criminal charges brought by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California. \u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was supervised by Assistant Regional Director Marc J. Blau with assistance from trial counsel Kathryn C. Wanner, both of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Cyrus P. Naderi, No. 4:25-CV-03122 (S.D. Tex. filed July 3, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against South Texas Trader for Fraudulent \"Free-Riding\" Scheme\n\n\n\nOn October 7, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against Cyrus P. Naderi of The Woodlands, Texas, for charges related to conducting a fraudulent \"free-riding\" scheme through which he attempted to profit by purchasing and selling stocks without having sufficient funds to pay for the trading.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, from April 2021 through March 2024, Naderi initiated at least $565,000 of unfunded deposits into brokerage accounts he controlled at four different broker-dealers. The SEC alleges that the brokerage deposits were drawn against bank accounts that Naderi knew lacked sufficient funds to cover the deposits. The SEC further alleges that the broker-dealers, unaware that the deposits were unfunded, extended instant deposit credit, allowing Naderi to conduct trades in the accounts. Ultimately, as alleged, the deposits were reversed when the broker-dealers rejected them for insufficient funds, or when Naderi placed a stop-payment order on the transfer from his bank accounts. According to the complaint, before the reversals and stop-payment order, Naderi executed several hundred trades, buying and selling securities valued at more than $22.4 million, and causing three of the broker-dealers to incur an aggregate loss of at least $65,770. According to the complaint, after the fraudulent deposit at the fourth broker-dealer was reversed, Naderi\u2019s trades were cancelled, preventing him from transferring out illicit trading profits.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Naderi consented to the entry of a final judgment, permanently enjoining him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment also imposes conduct based injunctions and orders Naderi to pay a $40,000 civil penalty.\n\nThe investigation was conducted by Jeff Cohen, of the SEC\u2019s Fort Worth Regional Office, under the supervision of Derek Kleinmann, with the assistance of Alex Lefferts of the SEC\u2019s Office of Investigative and Market Analytics. The litigation was led by Matthew Gulde under the supervision of Keefe Bernstein.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Anthony Viggiano, et al., No. 1:23-cv-08542 (S.D.N.Y. filed Sept. 28, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment and Imposes Industry Bars Against Former Financial Industry Analyst Charged with Insider Trading\n\n\n\nOn October 2, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final consent judgment against defendant Anthony Viggiano, whom the SEC previously charged with insider trading. On November 17, 2025, the SEC issued orders barring Viggiano from working in the securities industry.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on September 28, 2023, alleged that Viggiano, while working at two financial institutions, learned about impending merger and acquisition transactions and strategic partnerships before they were publicly announced. Viggiano allegedly tipped two of his close friends about the upcoming deals, and they bought and sold securities based on that information. The complaint also alleged that one of the friends tipped other individuals who also traded on the material nonpublic information originating from Viggiano.\n\nIn the district court action, Viggiano consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. The final judgment also ordered disgorgement of $35,000, which is deemed satisfied by the order of forfeiture entered in the parallel criminal case, United States v. Viggiano, Crim. No. 23-00497-VEC (S.D.N.Y.). Viggiano also agreed to settle administrative proceedings instituted by the SEC. Under the terms of those settlements, Viggiano is barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization; barred from participating in any offering of a penny stock; and suspended from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant under Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice, all with the right to apply for reentry or reinstatement after 10 years.\n\nThe case originated from the SEC's Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious trading patterns. The SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by Rachel Yeates and supervised by Gregory Kasper and Nicholas Heinke of the SEC\u2019s Denver Regional Office. The SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Market Abuse Unit staff members Jeffrey Oraker and John Rymas, and was supervised by Danielle Voorhees and Joseph Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Tex. filed Dec. 11, 2023)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Company and Founders in Cattle Ponzi Scheme\n\nOn September 19, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained final judgments against Agridime, LLC, Jed Wood, and Joshua Link, whom the SEC previously charged for their roles in operating a Ponzi scheme.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on December 11, 2023 in federal district court in Fort Worth, Texas, alleged that the defendants raised at least $191 million from at least January 2021 to December 2023 by selling investment contracts related to the purchase and sale of cattle. In connection with these contracts, the defendants allegedly promised to sell cattle to investors for a fixed price per head and, after a year, buy back the same cattle at a higher price to provide a specific guaranteed investment return, which ranged from 15% to as high as 32% for some contracts. In reality, the complaint alleged, the defendants did not purchase enough cattle to fulfill Agridime\u2019s contracts and instead diverted tens of millions of dollars in investor funds to make Ponzi payments to prior investors and to pay undisclosed sales commissions, including commissions of approximately $1.3 million to Wood and $1.3 million to Link and his wife.\n\nOn December 11, 2023, the Court entered a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other ancillary relief against the Defendants, including the appointment of a receiver.\n\nThe final judgments enjoin the defendants from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act, and prohibit Link and Wood from acting as officers and directors or participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of securities. The final judgments also order Wood to pay disgorgement of $1,959,309.67, pre-judgment interest of $373,676.49, and a civil penalty of $236,451; Link to pay disgorgement of $3,106,957.09, pre-judgment interest of $693,251.87, and a civil penalty of $3,106,957.09; and Agridime to pay disgorgement of $102,936,904 and prejudgment interest of $17,310,965.32. The disgorgement and prejudgment interest ordered against Agridime is deemed satisfied by the receiver\u2019s collection efforts.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s litigation was handled by Tyson M. Lies and Matthew Gulde and supervised by Keefe Bernstein of the SEC\u2019s Fort Worth Regional Office.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            Final Judgment - Agridime\n  \n\n              \n            Final Judgment - Jed Wood \n  \n\n              \n            Final Judgment - Joshua Link\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Pathyam Patel, No. 7:25-cv-01603 (N.D. Ala. filed Sept. 19, 2025)\n\nSEC Charges Pathyam Patel With Over $400,000 Fraud\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Pathyam Patel has agreed to settle charges that he fraudulently induced at least 15 individuals to invest over $430,000 with his company, Infinity Wealth Management, LLC (\u201cInfinity\u201d), by making numerous misrepresentations to clients about his and Infinity\u2019s qualifications, licensure, and endorsement by the Commission, how he would invest their funds and the profitability of the investments, and by guaranteeing the principal they invested.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, from January 2019 through March 2023, deceived prospective and current clients by telling them Infinity was registered with the Commission as an investment adviser that offered investment portfolio management services to a wide range of clients, and that he would invest their money in various stocks and options as well as crypto assets. The complaint further alleges that, rather than invest his clients\u2019 money as promised, Patel misappropriated most of their money to pay for personal expenses and to make Ponzi-like payments to other clients. The complaint also alleges that Patel further enriched himself by charging clients thousands of dollars in bogus fees, including so-called \u201ctransfer fees\u201d and fees purportedly owed to the SEC, IRS, and Virginia State Corporation Commission. The complaint further alleges that an order requiring Patel to make payments to investors was entered in connection with a parallel investigation conducted by the Alabama Securities Commission.\n\nPatel consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, which would permanently enjoin him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, enjoin him for a period of five years from acting as, or being associated with, any investment advisor, and enjoin him for a period of five years from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security (with the exception of trading in securities in his own account).\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Jennifer Miller and David Medway, with the assistance of trial counsel John V. Donnelly III, all of the SEC\u2019s Philadelphia Regional Office. Kingdon Kase, Gregory R. Bockin, and Scott A. Thompson, also of the SEC\u2019s Philadelphia Regional Office, supervised this matter.

(Sherman Division) filed July 1, 2022)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Consent Judgments Against Defendants in Multi-Million Dollar Ponzi Scheme\n\nOn August 5, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained final consent judgments against Justin R. Kimbrough and an entity that he controlled, Prosperity Consultants, LLC, stemming from their involvement in a Ponzi scheme that raised at least $3 million from at least 31 investors. The civil action remains pending against Kimbrough\u2019s and Prosperity\u2019s co-defendants, Terry Nikopoulos and four entities that Nikopoulos controlled.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed on July 1, 2022, alleged that from June 2020 through at least April 2021, Kimbrough and Nikopoulos told potential investors that investors\u2019 funds would finance a real estate wholesale business and the purchase of medical products for resale by a company in India. As alleged, however, rather than using investors\u2019 money to finance the two purported businesses, Kimbrough and Nikopoulos retained at least $1.75 million for themselves and paid approximately $1.05 million to existing investors as purported \u201cdividend\u201d or \u201cinterest\u201d payments in furtherance of the Ponzi scheme.\u00a0\n\nKimbrough and Prosperity consented to the entry of respective final judgments that permanently enjoin each of them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. The final judgment against Kimbrough also permanently enjoins him from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder. The final judgment against Kimbrough further imposes an officer and director bar and includes a conduct-based injunction that prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, other than on a national securities exchange for his own personal account. The final consent judgments entered against Kimbrough and Prosperity order them to pay jointly and severally disgorgement of $1,137,437.45 plus prejudgment interest of $86,882.82 thereon, with these amounts deemed satisfied by entry of a forfeiture order in the amount of $2,560,938.87 against Kimbrough in a parallel criminal proceeding.\n\nThe SEC's litigation is being led by John Timmer under the supervision of James Carlson. The investigation was conducted by John J. Dempsey and Ryan Farney under the supervision of Nina B.

Charles T. Lawrence, Jr. et. al., No. 2:23-cv-00550-PP (E.D. Wis. filed May 1, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment by Consent Against Relief Defendant in Offering Fraud Case\n\n\n\nOn August 25, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against relief defendant Justin D. Smith, of Ohio, in a litigated action involving an alleged offering fraud orchestrated by defendant Charles T. Lawrence, Jr.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Lawrence engaged in a scheme to defraud prospective investors and misappropriated at least $4.89 million for his personal benefit. As alleged, Lawrence misrepresented that he was the managing director of a defunct Swedish entity Landes and Compagnie Trust Prive KB (\u201cSwedish Landes KB\u201d) and that, among other things, the investment contracts he offered would generate weekly investment returns of 25% to 100%, and the investors\u2019 funds would not be at risk. The complaint alleges that Lawrence directed investors to send their money directly to an account in the name of Landes Prive, LLC, an entity he controlled, and then misappropriated almost all of the investor funds to make lavish personal purchases. In addition, the complaint alleges that Lawrence sent at least $689,000 to five relief defendants, including Smith\u2019s entity Landes and Compagnie Trust Prive aka Landes and Compagnie Trst [sic] Prive KB (\u201cLandes KB\u201d).\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Smith consented to the entry of a final judgment, ordering Smith to pay disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains totaling $297,700 plus $38,371 of prejudgment interest, jointly and severally with his entity, relief defendant Landes KB. The Commission had previously obtained a final default judgment against Landes KB for the same amounts on October 31, 2024, and the court\u2019s most recent ruling also modified Landes KB\u2019s final judgment to make the amounts ordered against it joint and several with Smith.\n\nPreviously, on October 31, 2024, the SEC obtained a final judgment by consent against relief defendant Brenda M. Bisner, ordering her to pay disgorgement of $183,951 plus prejudgment interest of $18,940; and final default judgments against relief defendant HekYeah, LLC, ordering it to pay disgorgement of $9,900 plus prejudgment interest of $1,392, and relief defendant Landes Prive, LLC, ordering it to pay disgorgement of $3,588,713 plus prejudgment interest of $402,534. The SEC\u2019s litigation against Lawrence is ongoing.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Matthew T. Wissa and supervised by Jeffrey A. Shank of the SEC\u2019s Chicago Regional Office.

Giltman, No. 2:22-cv-00051-ES-JRA (D.N.J., filed Jan. 5, 2022)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against California Man for Defrauding Investors Out of Millions of Dollars in Fake Certificate of Deposit Scam\n\nOn September 11, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a final consent judgment against Allen C. Giltman for his role in an internet-based fraudulent scheme that lured unsuspecting investors to websites offering fake certificates of deposit (\u201cCDs\u201d). The fake CDs scheme defrauded scores of U.S. investors, many of whom were older and using their retirement savings.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on January 5, 2022, alleged that Giltman worked with other perpetrators of the scheme to create a series of websites offering fake CDs at above-market rates. The complaint alleged that these websites used domain names intended to deceive investors into believing that they were investing with legitimate U.S.-based and multi-national financial firms. Some of the websites \u201cspoofed\u201d actual financial firms, while others purported to offer CDs from fake financial firms. As alleged, the spoofed websites created by Giltman and the other perpetrators of the scheme had no relationship with any legitimate financial firm, and the promised CDs did not exist.\n\nThe SEC charged Giltman with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. On April 8, 2022, the court entered a bifurcated consent judgment that enjoined Giltman from violating the charged provisions and enjoined him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer or sale of any security or engaging in activities for the purposes of inducing or attempting to induce the purchase of sale of any security, provided, however, that such injunction shall not prevent Giltman from purchasing or selling securities for his own personal account. On September 11, 2025, the court entered a final consent judgment that, in addition to including the above relief, ordered Giltman to pay disgorgement in the amount of $31,224,595, to be deemed satisfied by the restitution order against Giltman in a parallel criminal proceeding, United States v. Giltman, No. 2:22-cr-00002-ES (D.N.J.), in which Giltman pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 87 months in prison.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Elizabeth Doisy and Martin Zerwitz, and supervised by Paul Kim, of the Enforcement Division\u2019s Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit. The litigation was led by John Bowers and supervised by James Connor. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Mastroianni, Jr., a barred broker whom the SEC previously charged in connection with a $1.2 million fraudulent promissory note scheme targeting older Americans.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in August 2022, from at least February 2017 to May 2022 Mastroianni induced investors, ranging in age from 64 to 82, to purchase notes issued by his company, Global Business Development and Consulting Corp., by promising exorbitant interest rates ranging from 50% to 175%.\u00a0 As alleged, Mastroianni gave investors conflicting explanations of the nature of Global\u2019s business and often convinced them to roll-over their notes into new notes combining unpaid amounts with new investments.\u00a0 However, Global did not use investor monies to generate income but instead, as alleged, Mastroianni withdrew investor money from Global\u2019s bank account and used ill-gotten funds for personal expenses on luxury items.\u00a0\n\nIn a parallel criminal proceeding, United States v. Mastroianni, Crim. No. 23-717 (D.N.J.), on February 8, 2024, Mastroianni was sentenced to 45 months in prison followed by 3 years of supervised release for the $1.2 million investment fraud and for fraudulently obtaining a loan of approximately $96,000 meant for small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 Mastroianni was also ordered to pay restitution and forfeiture of $1.3 million.\u00a0 In light of Mastroianni\u2019s sentence, restitution, and forfeiture in the parallel proceeding, on September 8, 2025, the SEC advised the Court that it does not intend to pursue its remaining monetary relief against Mastroianni.\u00a0\n\nMastroianni consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from conduct violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. \u00a0This judgment concludes the SEC\u2019s litigation in this matter.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Christopher Dunnigan and Adam S.

Tomislav Vukota, Vukota Capital Management, LLC, and VCM Global Asset Management Ltd., No. 25-cv-02821 (D. Colo. filed Sept. 9, 2025)\n\n\n\nTomislav Vukota and His Two Advisory Firms Settle Charges for Breaches of Fiduciary Duty and Misrepresentations\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filed settled charges against former Colorado resident Tomislav \u201cTom\u201d Vukota (Vukota) and the two investment adviser entities he controls, Vukota Capital Management, LLC (VCM) and VCM Global Asset Management Ltd. (VGAM), for breaching their fiduciary duties and making material misrepresentations to private funds and investors who purchased limited partnership interests in those funds.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, the Defendants engaged in three distinct types of negligent misconduct. First, the complaint alleges that from at least 2017 through May 2022, Vukota and VCM caused various private funds they advised to make short-term loans to VCM at below-market rates to, among other things, cover cash shortfalls at other private funds. The complaint further alleges that the private funds\u2019 partnership agreements prohibited these loans, and neither the practice of providing such loans nor the resulting conflict of interest was disclosed to investors. Second, per the complaint, during February and March 2021, Vukota and VCM sent misleading letters to the investors in four private funds in connection with Vukota\u2019s attempt to buy the investors\u2019 interests. According to the complaint, the buyout letters failed to disclose Vukota\u2019s conflicts of interest, and Vukota and VCM failed to obtain investors\u2019 consent to those conflicts. Third, the complaint alleges that from at least 2017 through 2023, Vukota and VGAM made material misstatements in marketing and offering materials for the Vukota Multi-Strategy Fund concerning the existence of an auditor, the amount of assets under management, the investment strategy, and the filing status as an exempt reporting adviser.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, charges all Defendants with violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Vukota and VCM with violating Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Vukota and VGAM with violating Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the Defendants agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges, consenting to injunctions and total combined monetary relief of $6,943,212 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $1,766,582, and penalties of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by John Mulhern, Jeffrey Felder, Tracy Bowen, and Brian Fitzpatrick, with the assistance of Gregory Kasper, and was supervised by Corey Schuster and Kimberly Frederick of the Division of Enforcement\u2019s Asset Management Unit and Nicholas Heinke of the Denver Regional Office.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Nev. filed Sept. 4, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Settles with Las Vegas Residents and their Company in a Multimillion Dollar Investment Fraud Scheme\n\n\n\nOn September 4, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Las Vegas residents Calvin Guess and Marcus Ligon, along with their now defunct investing entity, 5 Fruits Enterprises LLC, with a scheme to defraud investors through false claims about 5 Fruits\u2019 use of automated \u201cbots\u201d in trading securities.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, from 2021 through 2023, Guess, Ligon, and 5 Fruits raised over $4.7 million from more than 140 investors by claiming that they would profitably invest their money using automated trading bots to execute options trading algorithms. As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Guess and Ligon promised incredible returns and directed the creation and distribution of fake account statements to make it appear the supposedly invested funds were growing. In reality, the SEC\u2019s complaint alleges, Guess and Ligon misappropriated most of the money to pay their personal expenses and used about $1 million of investor funds to make Ponzi-like payments to other investors.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Guess, Ligon, and 5 Fruits with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Guess, Ligon, and 5 Fruits each consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, which would permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions. The final judgment, if approved, also would hold them jointly and severally liable for payment of $1,156,166.13 in disgorgement, plus $253,048.11 in prejudgment interest; order Guess and Ligon to each pay a $236,451 civil penalty, and order 5 Fruits to pay a $1,182,251 civil penalty; hold Guess liable for an additional payment of $839,272.95 in disgorgement, plus $161,148.29 in prejudgment interest; hold Ligon liable for an additional payment of $1,035,527.11 in disgorgement, plus $198,081.95 in prejudgment interest; and impose a conduct-based injunction on Guess and Ligon prohibiting them from participating in securities offerings and from accepting investor funds.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Yolanda Ochoa, Bianca Cadena, and Dora Zaldivar, and supervised by Finola H. Manvelian, all of the Los Angeles Regional Office. Daniel S. Lim will lead the SEC\u2019s litigation under the supervision of Douglas M.

Ellison-Meade, whom the SEC previously charged with misappropriating funds that he raised from investors in an investment club he managed called Baycap.io.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on January 24, 2023, alleged that from at least 2019 to 2021, Ellison-Meade raised at least $2.8 million from approximately 31 individual investors for Baycap.io based on representations that he would use the funds to engage in algorithmic securities trading. The SEC\u2019s complaint further alleged that Meade never used investor funds to trade securities as represented, but rather misappropriated investor funds to pay for luxury items and to make Ponzi-like payments to other investors.\n\nThe judgment, entered on the basis of default, permanently enjoins Ellison-Meade from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security in an unregistered offering not for his personal account, and from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The Court also ordered Ellison-Meade to pay disgorgement of $2,917,751.02 and prejudgment interest thereon of $820,668.13, which the Court deemed satisfied by the order of restitution entered against Ellison-Meade in a parallel criminal case, United States v.

Ryan Squillante, No. 25-cv-01457 (D. Conn. filed Sept. 5, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Connecticut Resident with Insider Trading in Multiple Securities\n\n\n\nOn September 5, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed settled insider trading charges against Connecticut resident Ryan Squillante, who allegedly used confidential information that he obtained in the course of his employment at an investment firm to trade in the securities of at least ten different publicly-traded companies, earning approximately $216,965 in illegal trading profits.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Squillante, who worked as Head of Equity Trading at an investment firm from May 2021 through December 2023, often obtained material nonpublic information, including information concerning potential secondary offerings of securities by publicly-traded companies, as part of his employment. In the instances in which Squillante received such material nonpublic information about a company, the complaint alleges he knew and understood he was not permitted to trade in that company\u2019s stock until either the information was disclosed to the public or the information otherwise became stale, such as by the proposed offering being withdrawn by the company. As alleged, Squillante nonetheless traded based on material nonpublic information in his personal brokerage accounts on at least eleven occasions. According to the complaint, Squillante sold short the stock of the companies about which he had obtained material nonpublic information, essentially predicting that the company\u2019s stock would decrease in value because he had information that would negatively impact the stock price.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, charges Squillante with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil monetary penalties. Squillante has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and agreed to pay monetary relief in amounts to be determined by the Court upon motion of the Commission.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Sarah McAteer, Kathleen Shields, and Michele T. Perillo of the SEC\u2019s Boston Regional Office and Patrick McCluskey of the Market Abuse Unit.

Mo. filed May 3, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Default Judgments Against Missouri Adviser and His Firm on Offering Fraud Charges and Against Relief Defendant\n\n\n\nOn August 14, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment by default in a litigated action against Missouri resident Robert M. Thompson and a private entity he controls, The Financial Freedom Foundation d/b/a/ F3 Mastermind, for defrauding investors in three securities offerings. The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri also entered a final judgment by default against relief defendant Brandon K. Stucki for receiving ill-gotten gains to which he had no legitimate claim.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on May 3, 2024, alleged that Thompson marketed F3 Mastermind as a private membership group in which investors paid initial and monthly fees. Thompson and F3 Mastermind allegedly offered members investments in trading programs run by third-party operators that claimed to generate risk-free returns ranging from 20% per week to 4,000% per year. As alleged, between early 2019 and mid-2022, Thompson and F3 Mastermind recommended these investments to investors who subsequently invested in these programs. According to the complaint, F3 Mastermind members invested in these prime bank-like schemes and collectively provided at least $2 million to the third-party operators who conducted the schemes. Finally, the complaint alleged that relief defendant Brian K. Stucki received ill-gotten gains from the scheme to which he has no legitimate claim.\n\nThe Court entered a default judgment enjoining Thompson and F3 Mastermind from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The judgment also ordered Thompson and F3 Mastermind to pay $72,946 in disgorgement with $18,005 prejudgment interest on a joint and several basis, and a $36,000 civil penalty against each of Thompson and F3 Mastermind. The court further ordered Stucki to pay $9,994 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $2,689.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Eric M.

Through that employment, Chen and Zhen allegedly obtained material nonpublic information about clients\u2019 forthcoming announcement of events like mergers and earnings results. From around January to June 2025, despite their employer\u2019s prohibition on engaging in insider trading, Chen and Zhen allegedly traded on the basis of material nonpublic information on at least 13 occasions and generated over $2 million in ill-gotten profits.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charges Chen and Zhen with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.

Stock Purse Trading LLC, Liston Associates, Inc., and Carole A. Liston, No. 25-civ-81026 (S.D. Fla. filed Aug. 20, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Florida-based Companies Stock Purse Trading and Liston Associates and their Owner with Operating $5.7 Million Offering Fraud\n\n\n\nOn August 20, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged South Florida entities Stock Purse Trading LLC and Liston Associates, Inc. (together, \u201cSPT\u201d) and their founder, sole owner, and CEO Carole A. Liston of Yonkers, New York, with conducting a fraudulent securities offering that raised at least $5.7 million from 200 investors nationwide.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from August 2020 through July 2024, Defendants promised to pay investors exorbitant monthly returns based on Liston\u2019s purported stock trading strategy and expertise. The complaint alleges that Liston touted her purported investment experience and success in in trading for her own accounts, her expertise in investing in options, and proprietary trading algorithm for short selling stocks. Liston told investors that SPT would pool investor funds to achieve better returns and represented to investors the safety and security of her investment trading strategy. Liston promised SPT investors returns ranging from 5% to 20% monthly, or in some cases, a 100% return within 30 to 60 days. In reality, Liston only used a small portion of investor funds to purchase and trade securities and, when she did, her trading produced significant losses. Liston misappropriated at least $450,000 of investor funds for her personal benefit and used at least $3.9 million in investor funds to make Ponzi-like distributions to SPT investors.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges SPT and Liston with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Liston with violations of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest on a joint-and-several basis, and civil penalties.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, SPT and Liston agreed to partially settle the SEC\u2019s charges by consenting to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged provisions, with the amount of monetary remedies to be determined by the court at a later date, upon motion of the SEC. The partial settlements are subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Linda S. Schmidt and supervised by Sean M.

According to the complaint, however, Mr. Swensen misappropriated investor funds to make Ponzi-like payments to other investors and to pay for his, and his family\u2019s, personal expenses. The SEC did not allege wrongdoing by Ms. Swensen.\n\nMs. Swensen consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering her to pay a total of $3,839,009, consisting of $3,626,138 in disgorged investor funds, $41,279 in prejudgment interest, and $171,592 in interest Ms. Swensen earned on investor funds during the pendency of the case. The entire amount will be distributed to harmed investors by the court-appointed receiver, Chad S. Pehrson.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Joni Ostler of the Denver Regional Office and Pasha Salimi of the Home Office, under the supervision of Tanya G. Beard. The SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Jason Bussey and Andrew Hefty of the San Francisco Regional Office, with assistance from Leigh Barrett, Alex Lefferts, and Ellen Chen.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

As alleged, during that time, Yedid was a managing director at a consulting firm that assists pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with investor communications. In that role, according to the complaint, Yedid obtained material nonpublic information about the firm\u2019s clients\u2014including drug test results, financial and regulatory information, and pending mergers and acquisitions\u2014that he repeatedly shared with Kaufman and Jacobs, who then engaged in lucrative insider trading. As alleged, Kaufman shared his illicit proceeds with Yedid by handing him envelopes of cash.\n\nThe complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Yedid, Kaufman, and Jacobs with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Yedid, Kaufman, and Jacobs each consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions and authorizing the court to determine at a later date the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties that each defendant shall pay. Yedid also consented to a conduct-based injunction barring him from associating with a broker or dealer, and a bar preventing him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Jason Anthony, Nancy C. Iheanacho, and Margaret Vizzi, and supervised by Paul H. Pashkoff and Pei Y. Chung, all of the SEC\u2019s Home Office. The litigation will be led by Daniel Maher and supervised by David A.

Ashraf Mufareh and ONPASSIVE LLC a/k/a Gofounders and Ofounders, No. 6:23-cv-01539 (M.D. Fla. filed Aug. 11, 2023; amended complaint filed Nov. 6, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Alleged Perpetrators of Fraudulent Multi-Level Marketing Scheme and Unregistered Offering\n\n\n\nOn August 14, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against Ashraf Mufareh of Orlando, Florida, and his company, OnPassive LLC (together, the \"defendants\"), whom the SEC previously charged with orchestrating a fraudulent and unregistered offering of securities in a business that was structured as a pyramid scheme and making misrepresentations about the feasibility and likely profitability of the business. The entry of these final judgments, including the SEC\u2019s voluntary dismissal of its claims against relief defendant Asmahan Mufareh, concludes the SEC\u2019s litigation in this matter.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s amended complaint, filed on November 6, 2023 in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleged that, between 2018 and 2023, the defendants fraudulently raised more than $108 million from more than 800,000 investors across the globe, including in the United States, by falsely claiming, among other things, to be developing a suite of online computer applications that used artificial intelligence. According to the complaint, the defendants sold investors positions in a multi-level marketing arrangement and promised passive income from subscription fees paid by later investors for those computer applications. As of June 2023, however, defendant OnPassive LLC allegedly had not yet launched any product for a fee and had not made a single commission payment to any investor.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendants consented to entry of a final judgment that imposed permanent injunctive relief, which enjoins each of them from violating Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment also imposed on Mufareh an officer-and-director bar for a period of eight years and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $4,000,000, and ordered OnPassive LLC to pay disgorgement of $26,220,364, plus prejudgment interest of $1,218,528.40, and a civil penalty of $4,000,000.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by John Crimmins and Benjamin Perlman, and supervised by Nina B. Finston. The SEC's litigation was led by Devon Staren and Michael Friedman, and supervised by Jim Carlson. Karaz S.

(Chartered Accountants), enjoining them from violating certain provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering civil monetary penalties.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed September 30, 2024, against Oyebola and his firm alleges that they deliberately failed to take action upon learning that businessman Mmobuosi Odogwu Banye a/k/a Dozy Mmobuosi and three related U.S. companies that Mmobuosi controlled (the Tingo entities) created multiple fake audit reports bearing Oyebola\u2019s signature and included them in SEC filings as though they were issued by Oyebola\u2019s firm. Oyebola allegedly made material misstatements to one of the Tingo entities\u2019 then-auditor, and Oyebola and his firm helped Mmobuosi conceal that the audit reports were fake, resulting in the auditor, investors, and regulators relying upon the misstatements and fake audit reports to their detriment. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Oyebola\u2019s and his firm\u2019s assistance enabled Mmobuosi and the Tingo entities to carry out a multi-year scheme to inflate financial performance metrics and defraud investors worldwide.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Oyebola and his firm consented to the entry of final judgments that: (i) permanently enjoin Oyebola and his firm from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (ii) permanently enjoin Oyebola from violating Exchange Act Rules 13b2-2(a) and (b); and (iii) orders Oyebola and his firm to each pay civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000. \u00a0\n\nOn August 12, 2025, the Commission issued an order pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice against Oyebola and his firm based on the entry of the final judgments against them. \u00a0Oyebola and his firm agreed to be suspended from appearing and practicing before the Commission as accountants with a right to apply for reinstatement after six years.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by David Zetlin-Jones, Elisa Solomon, and Michael DiBattista under the supervision of Alexander Vasilescu, all of the New York Regional Office. \u00a0The Commission\u2019s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Mr. DiBattista, Wesley Wintermyer, Christopher Mele, and Rebecca Reilly under the supervision of Thomas P.

The final judgment further orders Moretz to pay $4,374.91 in disgorgement, $1,404.68 in prejudgment interest, and a $35,000 civil penalty.

Ryan N. Cole, No. 25-civ-01038 (E.D. Cal. filed Aug. 11, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges California Resident for Engaging in a Manipulative Options Spoofing Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against Ryan N. Cole, a resident of Folsom, California, for allegedly conducting a manipulative trading scheme known as spoofing through which he obtained approximately $234,000 in ill-gotten gains.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Cole, while working as a trader for a financial firm, placed fake\u2014or spoof\u2014orders to manipulate the prices of thinly traded options, and then executed different orders at the resulting manipulated prices. Cole\u2019s alleged scheme included placing multiple spoof orders across neighboring options series. To facilitate desired executions across these series, Cole used the complex order book to place multi-leg immediate-or-cancel orders. After his immediate-or-cancel orders were executed, Cole then cancelled his spoof orders. The SEC\u2019s complaint further alleges that Cole took steps to conceal his spoofing scheme from the firm by providing false and misleading responses to questions posed about his trading. Ultimately, Cole was terminated by the firm.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the Eastern District of California, charges Cole with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. The complaint also charges Cole with violating Section 9(a)(2) of the Exchange Act. Cole, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, has consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, imposing permanent injunctive relief for the charged provisions and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $234,803 plus prejudgment interest of $52,656, and a civil penalty of $70,441. The final judgment would also prohibit Cole, for a period of five years, from, directly or indirectly, opening, maintaining or trading in any brokerage account(s) in his name, the names of any immediate family members, the name of any company over which he has any control or the names of any third party individual(s), without providing the relevant broker-dealer(s) a copy of the complaint and final judgment entered against him.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Seth Nadler, Andrew McFall, John Marino, and David Bennett of the Enforcement Division\u2019s Market Abuse Unit, under the supervision of Paul Kim and Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and with the assistance of trial counsel Zachary Avallone under the supervision of Christopher Bruckmann. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Tavlin, a former Mazor Robotics Ltd. executive whom the SEC previously charged with insider trading in advance of the September 20, 2018 announcement that Medtronic PLC would acquire Mazor.\n\nThe complaint alleges that while working as a Mazor executive, Tavlin was involved in discussions regarding Medtronic\u2019s potential acquisition of Mazor.\u00a0 In August 2018, he tipped material nonpublic information about the potential acquisition to his close friend, Afshin Farahan, who then tipped his friend, David Gantman.\u00a0 According to the complaint, Farahan and Gantman both made multiple purchases of Mazor securities and realized approximately $500,000 in combined trading profits.\u00a0 Farahan later gave Tavlin a $25,000 kickback in exchange for the Mazor information, as alleged in the complaint.\n\nTavlin consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and imposing an officer and director bar.\u00a0 He was ordered to pay disgorgement of $25,000, representing his net profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint, together with prejudgment interest in the amount of $7,875.47.\n\nThe case originated from the SEC\u2019s Market Abuse Unit\u2019s Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious trading patterns.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation is being led by Stephen Kam and supervised by Douglas Miller of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00a0 The SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Sara Kalin of the Market Abuse Unit, and supervised by Assistant Director Diana Tani and Market Abuse Unit Chief Joseph Sansone.\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Minnesota, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Doron A.

Rocha, whom the SEC previously charged with running a Ponzi scheme in which he took over $1 million from 13 investors in the Cape Verdean community around the Boston area.\n\nThe SEC's complaint was filed in August 2023 and charged Rocha with having promised investors he would invest their money in securities with guaranteed returns of 12% per month. Instead, the complaint alleged, Rocha used only a small percentage of the money to make highly leveraged, and highly unsuccessful, trades of stock and stock options. Rocha allegedly spent the balance of the funds, the vast majority, to feed his gambling habit and embark on a luxury lifestyle. According to the complaint, Rocha also used money from later investments to pay out on earlier investments.\n\nRocha consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The SEC previously charged Gupta with insider trading ahead of an announcement that Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., then Gupta\u2019s employer, had agreed to acquire Epizyme, Inc.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on September 10, 2024, alleged that Gupta became aware of Ipsen\u2019s interest in acquiring Epizyme or its premier drug months before the transaction was publicly announced. According to the complaint, Gupta purchased Epizyme shares while aware of that material non-public information and, after the announcement was made, sold the shares and realized approximately $260,000 in illicit profits.\n\nThe SEC charged Gupta with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. On September 24, 2024, the court entered a bifurcated consent judgment that enjoined Gupta from violating the charged provisions and prohibited him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. On July 29, 2025, the court entered a final consent judgment that, in addition to including the above relief, found Gupta liable for disgorgement of $260,078 and prejudgment interest of $36,801, for a total of $296,879, payment of which will be offset by $260,078, the amount of forfeiture ordered against Gupta in a parallel criminal proceeding, United States v. Gupta, 24-cr-10279 (JEK) (D.

Craffy, whom the SEC previously charged with defrauding Gold Star family members and others by engaging in unauthorized trading in customer accounts and recommending excessive trades and high-risk strategies that did not match customers\u2019 investment profiles. In a parallel criminal proceeding, United States v. Craffy, Crim. No. 23-541 (D.N.J.), on August 22, 2024, Craffy was sentenced to 151 months in prison followed by 3 years of supervised release and ordered to pay $1,482,741.41 in forfeiture, and on January 7, 2025, he was ordered to pay $4,085,988.32 in restitution. In light of Craffy\u2019s sentence, forfeiture, and restitution in the parallel criminal proceeding, on July 14, 2025, the SEC advised the Court that it does not intend to pursue its remaining monetary claims against Craffy, which the Court ordered on July 16, 2025. This concludes the SEC\u2019s litigation in this matter.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Craffy was permitted to provide general financial education to service members\u2019 families through his job as a U.S. Army financial counselor. However, as alleged, between May 2018 and November 2022, Craffy directed grieving family members to transfer their benefits into brokerage accounts he managed while working full-time for private brokerage firms. Once the funds were transferred, Craffy allegedly engaged in unauthorized and excessive trading that exposed his customers to higher risks of loss, resulting in realized losses of approximately $1.79 million, including approximately $1.64 million in fees and commissions, most of which were paid to Craffy personally.\u00a0\n\nThe complaint charged Craffy with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5 and 15l-1(a)(1) thereunder.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was handled by Hayden M.

Old South Trading Co., LLC, Brendan H. Church, and Edwin N. Church, No. 6:25-cv-00334 (D.S.C. filed Jan. 17, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgments Against Father and Son for $25.8 Million Unregistered Securities Offering\n\n\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina entered final judgments against defendants Brendan Church and Edwin N. \u201cChuck\u201d Church (\u201cChuck Church\u201d), whom the SEC previously charged with engaging in an unregistered securities offering. The SEC also previously charged Chuck Church for acting as an unregistered broker in connection with the offering.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on January 17, 2025, alleged that Brendan Church and his father Chuck Church, through Old South Trading Co., LLC (\u201cOld South\u201d), raised approximately $25.8 million dollars through the unregistered offer and sale of demand promissory notes from approximately 100 investors, including unaccredited investors and investors identified through a social media forum. The complaint alleged that Chuck Church acted as an unregistered broker in connection with the offering by, among other things, soliciting investors, handling paperwork and correspondence with investors, and making recommendations regarding the investments, in exchange for transaction-based compensation from Old South. According to the complaint, no registration statement was in effect with respect to the sale of the promissory notes, and no exemptions from registration were applicable. Old South allegedly stopped making investor interest payments and honoring investor redemption requests in June 2022, resulting in more than $11.6 million in losses to at least 79 investors.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Brendan Church and Chuck Church each consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and enjoining Chuck Church from violating Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The final judgments also ordered Brendan Church to pay a civil penalty of $300,000, ordered Chuck Church to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and ordered Chuck Church to pay disgorgement of $15,358 plus prejudgment interest thereon. The judgments barred Brendan Church and Chuck Church from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, other than purchasing or selling securities for their own personal accounts, and barred Chuck Church from acting as or being associated with a broker or dealer. Upon entry of the judgments, the SEC also filed a notice of dismissal of defendant Old South with prejudice, concluding the litigation.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Anna Area and supervised by James Carlson. The SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Andrew Elliott, Jonathan Shapiro, and Margaret Vizzi, and supervised by Michael Brennan. The SEC would like to thank the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of South Carolina for their assistance in litigating this matter.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Brendan H.

Brian M. Kashman, No. 2:25-cv-02554 (D. Ariz. filed July 21, 2025)\n\nSEC Charges Scottsdale Resident with Insider Trading\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission on July 21, 2025, filed settled insider trading charges against Brian M. Kashman, a resident of Scottsdale, Arizona, for trading in the stock of US Xpress Enterprises, Inc. based on material, nonpublic information about the potential acquisition of US Xpress learned from a long-time friend who was an insider at the potential acquiror.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, Kashman met in person with his friend, who held a senior position at Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings, Inc., a trucking company headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona. The complaint alleges that the insider mentioned to Kashman that Knight-Swift was in negotiations to buy US Xpress, information the insider knew was material and nonpublic. As alleged, the insider trusted his friend to keep the information confidential and did not expect Kashman to trade on the information. The day after their meeting, the complaint alleges, Kashman sold $30,000 worth of shares of a mutual fund he held and used those proceeds, and additional funds, to purchase 18,200 shares of US Xpress at $1.67 per share. When US Xpress announced on March 21, 2023 that Knight-Swift made an offer to purchase US Xpress, the price of US Xpress stock rose nearly 300%, according to the complaint. On the following day, as alleged, Kashman sold all of his US Xpress shares for $5.95 per share, resulting in illicit profits of $77,723.\n\nThe complaint charges Kashman with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Kashman, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, has consented to the entry of a final judgment imposing permanent injunctive relief, which would enjoin him from violating the charged provisions, and order him to pay disgorgement of $77,723 plus prejudgment interest of $12,201, and a civil penalty of $77,723. The judgment is subject to court approval.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by David Frisof and Brian Vann and was supervised by Brian O.

Edwin Brant Frost IV and First Liberty Building & Loan, LLC, Civil Action No. 1:25-cv-03826 (N.D. Ga. filed July 10, 2025)\n\nSEC Charges Georgia-based First Liberty Building & Loan and its Owner for Operating a $140 Million Offering Fraud\n\nOn July 10, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges seeking an asset freeze and other emergency relief against Georgia-based First Liberty Building & Loan, LLC and its founder and owner Edwin Brant Frost IV in connection with a Ponzi scheme that defrauded approximately 300 investors of at least $140 million.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from approximately 2014 through June 2025, First Liberty and Frost offered and sold to retail investors promissory notes and loan participation agreements that offered returns of up to 18% by representing that investor funds would be used to make short-term bridge loans to businesses at relatively high interest rates. The defendants allegedly told investors that very few of these loans had defaulted and that they would be repaid by borrowers via Small Business Administration or other commercial loans. The complaint also alleges that, while some investor funds were used to make bridge loans, those loans did not perform as represented, and most loans ultimately defaulted and ceased making interest payments. Since at least 2021, First Liberty operated as a Ponzi scheme by using new investor funds to make principal and interest payments to existing investors, according to the complaint. The complaint further alleges that Frost misappropriated investor funds for personal use, including by using investor funds to make over $2.4 million in credit card payments, paying more than $335,000 to a rare coin dealer, and spending $230,000 on family vacations.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, charges First Liberty and Frost with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and names five entities that Frost controlled as relief defendants. The SEC seeks emergency relief, including an order freezing assets, appointing a receiver over the entities, and granting an accounting and expedited discovery. The SEC also seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties against defendants, a conduct-based injunction against Frost, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest against defendants and relief defendants.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants and relief defendants consented to the proposed judgment ordering the SEC\u2019s requested emergency and permanent relief, with monetary remedies to be determined by the court at a later date. On July 11, 2025, the District Court granted all relief sought by the SEC. The SEC\u2019s investigation remains ongoing.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Justin Delfino and Tiffany Kunkle and supervised by Peter Diskin and Justin C. Jeffries, all of the SEC\u2019s Atlanta Regional Office.

Jerry D. Guess, et al, No. 8:24-cv-00172 (D. Neb. filed May 9, 2024)\n\nSEC Obtains Default Judgment Against Convicted Felon for Offering Fraud\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska entered a final judgment on July 7, 2025 against Jerry D. Guess, a convicted felon, and his company, Guess & Co. Corporation (\u201cGuess & Co.\u201d), whom the SEC previously charged with conducting a fraudulent offering of Guess & Co. stock.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s amended complaint, from at least June 2021 through April 2022, the Defendants made multiple false and misleading statements of material facts to at least 57 prospective investors in at least 12 states and one foreign country to solicit them to invest in Guess & Co. stock. The amended complaint alleges that the Defendants falsely represented to prospective investors that Guess & Co. was a diversified energy, health care, technology, and real estate company that had earned millions of dollars in revenue from its business operations in 2019 to 2021, and they misleadingly projected the company would earn billions in revenue in both 2021 and 2022. However, as alleged in the amended complaint, during the period of the offering, Guess & Co. had no operations, customers, or business revenue other than the sales of 19 computers to electronics re-sale shops for $14,654.\n\nThe judgment, entered on the basis of default, enjoins Jerry Guess and Guess & Co. from violating Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. The judgment also enjoins Jerry Guess and Guess and Co. for a period of five years from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, except to the extent that Jerry Guess may purchase and sell securities for his own account. In addition, the judgment orders Jerry Guess to pay a civil penalty of $15,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by James G. O\u2019Keefe and Wilburn Saylor and supervised by Steven L.

Robert Brian Thompson, No. 3:24-cv-00800-MHL (E.D. Va. filed Nov. 8, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment against Richmond Federal Reserve Banking Supervisor Charged with Insider Trading\n\n\n\nOn July 18, 2025, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia entered a final consent judgment against Robert Brian Thompson, a long-time banking supervisor and examiner at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, whom the SEC previously charged with insider trading in stock and options of two publicly traded banks that were under his supervisory purview.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on November 8, 2024, alleged that in October 2023, Thompson obtained a preview of an upcoming positive earnings announcement by one of the banks in his supervisory portfolio, and used that information to buy $678,000 worth of the bank\u2019s stock hours before the scheduled announcement. The SEC\u2019s complaint further alleged that, in January 2024, Thompson learned that a different bank in his supervisory portfolio would be disclosing unexpected loan losses worth hundreds of millions of dollars as part of an upcoming earnings announcement, and then used that information to buy thousands of put options on the bank\u2019s stock two days before the scheduled announcement. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Thompson obtained ill-gotten profits of $584,873 from these unlawful trades.\n\nThe SEC charged Thompson with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. On December 20, 2024, the court entered a bifurcated consent judgment in which Thompson was enjoined from violating the charged antifraud provisions. On July 18, 2025 the court entered a final consent judgment in which Thompson agreed to pay disgorgement of $584,873 and prejudgment interest thereon of $67,750, the payment of which was deemed satisfied by the entry of a forfeiture order against Thompson in a parallel criminal proceeding, United States v. Thompson, 3:24-cr-00164-MHL (E.D. Va.), in which Thompson pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 24 months in prison.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Derek M. Schoenmann, David Bennett and Lindsay S. Moilanen of the Market Abuse Unit and supervised by Market Abuse Unit Chief Joseph G. Sansone. The SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Mr. Schoenmann and Nicholas Margida. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Division Fraud Section, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, and the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Office of the Inspector General.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Suyun Gu, et al., No. 1:21-cv-17578 (D.N.J. filed Sept. 27, 2021)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Ordering Over $1.3 Million in Monetary Relief Against Individual In Wash Trading Scheme Involving Liquidity Rebates\n\nOn July 9, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against Suyun Gu, who was previously charged with engaging in a fraudulent trading scheme to collect liquidity rebates from security exchanges through wash trading of thinly-traded put options in early 2021.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on September 27, 2021, and amended on December 19, 2022, Gu and his co-defendant, Yong Lee, used broker-dealer accounts that paid liquidity rebates to place options orders on one side of the market, and then used other broker-dealer accounts that did not charge fees for taking liquidity for subsequent orders on the other side of the market for the same options, resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal profits. The Court entered a consent judgment against Lee on all claims on September 29, 2021.\n\nOn September 6, 2024, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all of its claims against Gu. The Court found that Gu executed more than 11,000 wash trades between accounts he controlled, involving approximately three million options contracts, in violation of Sections 9(a)(1) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 17(a)(1) and (2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d). The Court also found that Gu (1) went to great lengths to conceal his trading scheme and to deceive other market participants including by using a series of virtual private servers to mask his internet protocol address and hide the fact that he was trading in others\u2019 accounts; (2) added false information to the trading account profiles of friends and family whose accounts he traded in; (3) made false and misleading statements to brokerage firms when they asked questions about his trading; and (4) willfully ignored red flags about the propriety of his conduct by continuing his scheme at other brokerage firms after his trading accounts were suspended, after his co-defendant Lee stopped trading, and even after Lee sent him an article defining wash trading.\u00a0\n\nOn July 9, 2025, the Court entered a final judgment permanently enjoining Gu from violating Exchange Act Sections 9(a)(1) and 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Securities Act Section 17(a). The Court also ordered Gu to pay $621,703 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus $134,663 in prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil penalty of $621,703.\u00a0\n\nThe Commission\u2019s litigation was led by John Bowers, Edward Reilly, and Andrew McFall, with supervision by James Connor. The SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Mr. McFall, with the assistance of Matthew Koop and Mandy Sturmfelz, of the Market Abuse Unit, and Maxwell Clarke, of the SEC's Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and supervised by Paul Kim and Joseph Sansone.\n\u00a0\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            SEC Complaint\n  \n\n              \n            Motion For Summary Judgment\n  \n\n              \n            Order and Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Trijya Vakil and Neeraj Visen, No. 7:25-cv-05697 (S.D.N.Y., filed July 10, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Former Animal Health Company Senior Director and Tippee with Insider Trading\n\n\n\nOn July 10, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed insider trading charges against two individuals, Trijya Vakil and Neeraj Visen, for allegedly trading in stock of Kindred Biosciences, Inc. based on material nonpublic information about the impending acquisition of Kindred by Vakil\u2019s employer.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Vakil, then Senior Director, Product Innovation at Elanco Animal Health, Inc., learned about the upcoming Kindred acquisition in April 2021, when she was assigned to Elanco\u2019s due diligence team for the transaction. The SEC alleges that Vakil purchased 500 shares of Kindred stock on the basis of that material nonpublic information regarding the acquisition, and when Kindred\u2019s stock price rose by approximately 46% following the acquisition announcement, Vakil obtained ill-gotten gains of $2,447.50. The SEC further alleges that Vakil tipped her friend, Neeraj Visen, about the upcoming Kindred acquisition, including telling him on June 15, 2021 that the acquisition would be announced within a day or two. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Visen then purchased 38,000 shares of Kindred stock, and when the stock price rose after the announcement, Visen obtained ill-gotten gains of $109,437.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Vakil and Visen with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks final judgments against both Vakil and Visen enjoining them from committing future violations of the charged antifraud provisions, prohibiting them from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act or that is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Visen and Vakil have each consented to the entry of judgments against them and to be enjoined from further misconduct, with monetary relief, if any, to be determined later by the Court. The settlements are subject to Court approval.\n\nVakil and Visen each pleaded guilty to criminal charges in parallel actions brought by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Derek M. Schoenmann, Jawad B. Muaddi, and Assunta Vivolo of the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division\u2019s Market Abuse Unit, Jordan Baker of the New York Regional Office, and supervised by Market Abuse Unit Chief Joseph G. Sansone.

The complaint also alleged that, instead of investing investor funds as promised, Fernandez used investor money to pay for her day-to-day living expenses and lavish hotel stays, fund numerous cash withdrawals, and make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors.\n\nIn a parallel criminal action brought by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of West Virginia arising out of the same conduct, Fernandez pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343. On March 27, 2025, Fernandez was sentenced to: (1) incarceration of thirty-three months; (2) supervised release of three years; (3) restitution of $330,144; and (4) forfeiture of $330,144.\n\nFernandez entered into a settlement with the SEC, in which she consented to the entry of a judgment against her imposing: (1) injunctions preventing further violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; (2) an injunction preventing her from the offer or sale of a security; and (3) an order of disgorgement in the amount of $296,021, deemed satisfied by her criminal forfeiture amount.\n\nThe litigation was handled by Christopher R. Kelly and supervised by Gregory R. Bockin of the SEC\u2019s Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC\u2019s investigation that led to this action was conducted by Michael F.

Keith A. Rosenbaum, William A. Justice, Randell R. Torno, and Brian D. Shibley, No. 3:25-cv-01716 (N.D. Tex. filed July 1, 2025)\n\nSEC Charges Public Company CEOs and Disbarred Attorney in Penny-Stock Fraud Scheme\n\nOn July 1, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged William A. Justice, Brian D. Shibley, and Randell R. Torno, each a former Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of a penny-stock public company, and Keith A. Rosenbaum, a disbarred California attorney, for their roles in an alleged $112 million pump-and-dump scheme orchestrated by Texas resident Philip Verges. The SEC previously filed charges against Verges and others on September 26, 2023, for their roles in the alleged scheme.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that, from approximately June 2017 through June 2022, at Verges\u2019 direction, the CEOs signed, or allowed their signatures to appear on, disclosure statements published a penny stock trading platform that they reasonably should have known contained materially false and misleading information regarding who prepared the penny-stock issuers\u2019 financial statements and also concealed Verges\u2019s control of the penny-stock issuers. In addition, the complaint alleges that, at Verges\u2019s direction, each CEO executed documents that facilitated share issuances to Verges\u2019s nominees without exercising reasonable care in inquiring whether the issuances were appropriate and/or accurate. The SEC\u2019s complaint further alleges that Rosenbaum authored at least 17 attorney opinion letters for one of Verges\u2019s nominees after being suspended from practicing law by the State Bar of California, and subsequently authored at least 73 more opinion letters after he was disbarred.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, charges the CEOs with violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and Rosenbaum with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The CEOs, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violations of the charged statutes, imposing a penny-stock bar and officer-and-director bar against each CEO, ordering Torno to pay disgorgement of $22,398.08 plus prejudgment interest of $2,011.92, and ordering Torno and Shibley to each pay a civil penalty of $35,000. Rosenbaum, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, consented to a bifurcated settlement permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provision and ordering disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny-stock bar to be resolved upon a motion by the SEC.\n\nThe investigation was conducted by Christopher Reynolds and Carol Stumbaugh of the SEC\u2019s Fort Worth Regional Office, under the supervision of Derek Kleinmann and B. David Fraser. The litigation will be led by Jason P. Reinsch and supervised by Keefe M. Bernstein.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            Final Judgment - Brian Shibley\n  \n\n              \n            Judgment - Keith Rosenbaum\n  \n\n              \n            Final Judgment - Randell Torno\n  \n\n              \n            Final Judgment - William Justice\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Nicholas A. Palazzo, 4TA Sports, Inc., NP Ventures Holdings, LLC and Play Caller Sports Gaming LLC, No. 5:24-cv-06602 (N.D. Cal. filed Sept. 20, 2024)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Former Harvard Football Player Nicholas Palazzo and his Corporate Entities for Orchestrating Two Fraudulent Schemes\n\nOn June 30, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered final judgment against defendants Nicholas A. Palazzo and his corporate entities, 4TA Sports, Inc., NP Ventures Holdings, LLC, and Play Caller Sports Gaming LLC, whom the SEC previously charged with stealing more than $2 million from investors, including Palazzo\u2019s former Harvard football teammates, a professional athlete, and others, through two securities fraud schemes.\n\nThe SEC's Complaint, filed on September 20, 2024, alleged that in the first scheme, Palazzo, through 4TA Sports, raised investor funds for the purported repurchase of the assets of a sports media company. And, in the second scheme, Palazzo, through NP Ventures Holdings and Play Caller Sports Gaming, allegedly raised investor funds to develop and launch a sports betting app. According to the complaint, in both schemes, Palazzo misled investors about how their funds would be used before misappropriating their funds to pay personal expenses, including his children\u2019s private school tuition, his personal rent, and a trip to Disneyland. The SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that Palazzo and 4TA Sports raised $900,000 from three investors and misappropriated nearly all of these funds, while Palazzo, NP Ventures, and Play Caller Sports Gaming raised $2.2 million from 22 investors and misappropriated more than three quarters of those funds.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Palazzo and the corporate defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment also ordered Palazzo to pay disgorgement in the amount of $2,648,132.73 plus prejudgment interest thereon in, with the corporate defendants being jointly and severally liable for portions of this amount, and to individually pay a $150,000 civil penalty. The final judgment bars Palazzo from acting as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years and prohibits Palazzo from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security for a period of five years, other than purchasing or selling securities for his own personal accounts.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Carina A. Cuellar and Brian Fitzsimons and supervised by Christopher Bruckmann. The SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Brittany Frassetto and Lauren Poper and supervised by Pei Chung and Stacy Bogert. \n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Cobb allegedly executed the scheme by buying securities in an omnibus account and then often waiting a day or longer to allocate the trades, which allowed him to see whether the securities had increased in price. The SEC\u2019s complaint also alleged that Cobb routinely placed clients in highly volatile and risky investments that were inconsistent with their investment profiles.\n\nCobb, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, consented to the entry of the judgment that enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, imposes a bar from associating with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser, orders disgorgement of $114,093 plus prejudgment interest thereon of $22,293.33, and orders a civil monetary penalty of $25,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Bennett Ellenbogen, James Flynn, Richard Primoff, and Lindsay S. Moilanen and was supervised by Sheldon L. Pollock, all of the SEC\u2019s New York Regional Office.

Hernandez, No. 23-civ-08110 (E.D.N.Y. filed Oct. 31, 2023)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Hernandez for Principal Role in \u201cFreeRiding\u201d Scheme\n\n\n\nOn June 30, 2025, the SEC obtained a final judgment against defendant Eduardo Hernandez for his role in a $2 million \u201cfree-riding\u201d scheme.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint filed on October 31, 2023, alleged that from approximately November 2018 through January 2022, Hernandez and three other defendants, all current or former residents of Long Island, perpetrated a free-riding scheme to enrich themselves. According to the complaint, the defendants opened and used unfunded brokerage accounts (\u201closer accounts\u201d) to generate trading profits by engaging in matched trading with other brokerage accounts that they also controlled (\u201cwinner accounts\u201d). The complaint alleged that the defendants opened the loser accounts at a broker that provided an instant deposit credit, which they used to fund the loser accounts\u2019 trades with the winner accounts at manipulated prices, using thinly-traded options. The complaint also alleged that in doing so, the defendants essentially transferred the credit provided by the broker from the loser accounts to the winner accounts, accumulating guaranteed profits at the broker\u2019s expense. The SEC alleges that defendants then abandoned the loser accounts, leaving the broker with the loss. All told, over the relevant period, defendants allegedly used at least 600 brokerage accounts to repeatedly conduct the fraudulent scheme. Specifically, the complaint alleged that Hernandez was the mastermind of the scheme and recruited individuals to open and provide him access to and control over the unfunded loser accounts. The complaint further alleged that Hernandez directed the transfer of the trading profits from the winner accounts to himself typically within a few days of realizing them.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charged Hernandez with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b5(a) and (c) thereunder and further violating these provisions by acting through or by means of another person in violation of Exchange Act Section 20(b). Previously, on September 24, 2024, in the SEC\u2019s case, the Court entered a bifurcated consent judgment against Hernandez enjoining him from violations of the charged provisions and ordering a conduct-based injunction that permanently enjoined him from directly or indirectly trading securities in any brokerage account he owns, controls or has access to that does not have settled cash equal to or greater than the amount of the securities trade(s). The final consent judgment against Hernandez, entered on June 30, 2025, reimposed the previous relief, ordered him to pay disgorgement of $525,355 and prejudgment interest thereon of $122,996, payment of which is deemed satisfied by the order of restitution entered against him in the parallel criminal action, United States v. Hernandez et al., 23 cr. 428 (E.D.N.Y.), and imposed a second conduct-based injunction prohibiting Hernandez from opening a brokerage account without first providing to the relevant brokerage firm(s) a copy of the Commission\u2019s filed Complaint and the judgment in this matter for a period of five (5) years.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Cynthia A. Matthews, David Austin, Matthew Lambert, John Marino, Pat McCluskey, and Lindsay S. Moilanen of the SEC\u2019s New York Regional Office and the SEC Enforcement Division\u2019s Market Abuse Unit, and was supervised by Joseph Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. The SEC\u2019s litigation is being led by Christopher J. Dunnigan, Ms. Matthews, and Ms. Moilanen, and is being supervised by Jack Kaufman and Mr. Sansone.

Ill. filed May 27, 2021)\n\nSEC Settles Charges Against Advisers and Portfolio Managers in Lawsuit Alleging Misrepresentations About Risks in Funds That Lost More than $1 Billion\n\n\n\nOn June 30, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained final judgments by consent against Defendants Antony Caine, Anish Parvataneni, LJM Funds Management, Ltd. (\u201cLJMFM\u201d) and LJM Partners, Ltd. (collectively with LJMFM, \u201cLJM\u201d), whom the SEC previously charged with allegedly defrauding investors by making false and misleading statements about the risks of LJM\u2019s \u201cnet short\u201d options trading strategy and LJM\u2019s risk management practices.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties and made material misrepresentations relating to the worst-case loss estimates for the LJM managed funds and the funds\u2019 risks. The complaint further alleged that the misrepresentations allowed defendants to grow their assets under management, resulting in them receiving millions of dollars of compensation. In February 2018, during a large spike in market volatility, the Funds suffered more than $1 billion in trading losses, according to the complaint.\n\nThe final judgments, to which all defendants consented without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, permanently enjoined each of the defendants from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; Caine, LJMFM, and Parvataneni from violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder; LJMFM and Parvataneni from violations of Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940; and LJMFM from violations of Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act and Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder. The final judgment ordered LJMFM and Caine to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $1,720,317 with prejudgment interest of $699,129; LJM Partners and Caine to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $1,567,713 with prejudgment interest of $637,112; and Parvataneni to pay disgorgement of $512,724 with prejudgment interest of $208,368. The final judgment further ordered Caine to pay a $500,000 civil penalty and Parvataneni to pay a $200,000 civil penalty, and enjoined Caine for three years, and Parvataneni for one year, from managing or advising on securities investments for, or acting as or being associated with an investment adviser to, any third-party, except for their wives and children.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Kevin Wisniewski, Jake Schmidt, Marlene Key-Patterson, and Terrance Moran of the SEC\u2019s Chicago Regional Office, under the supervision of Jeffrey Shank.

Rajesh Markan, No. 3:25-cv-01653 (N.D. Tex. filed June 27, 2025)\n\nSEC Charges Former Registered Representative of Brokerage Firms with Defrauding Customers\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against Rajesh Markan, formerly a registered representative and investment adviser representative employed by two securities brokerage firms, for soliciting his brokerage customers to invest in a fake private equity fund.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from at least 2015 through July 2024, Markan, while working as a registered representative of two dually-registered broker-dealers and investment advisers, solicited approximately ten of his brokerage customers to invest, collectively, approximately $2.9 million in a purported private equity fund. The SEC alleges that Markan told the investors that a well-known New York private equity firm advised the fund, which Markan called \u201cIntrinsic Value Portfolio.\u201d The complaint alleges that because Markan claimed it was a private equity investment, Markan told investors that their money would be tied up for six to twelve years, but he assured them that, ultimately, they could expect to make above-market returns. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, none of these representations were true: the fund was fake and never existed, there was no association with the New York private equity firm, and Markan misappropriated most of the investors\u2019 money for himself. The SEC also alleges that Markan lulled investors by sending fabricated statements purporting to show their account balances, and Markan created a fake domain name so he could send emails as a purported employee of the New York private equity firm.\n\nIn a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Texas filed criminal charges against Markan in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, to which he pled guilty on June 10, 2025. Additionally, on October 1, 2024, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) barred Markan from associating with any FINRA member.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas Division), charges Markan with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Markan agreed to a bifurcated settlement and consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions and ordering that monetary remedies (disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty) will be determined by the Court upon a future motion by the SEC. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe investigation was conducted by Robert Boudreau and Keith Hunter of the SEC\u2019s Fort Worth Regional Office and was supervised by Samantha Martin and B. David Fraser. The litigation will be led by Tyson Lies and supervised by Keefe Bernstein. The SEC appreciates the assistance of FINRA, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Texas.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

But Alexander defrauded investors by instead using a substantial amount of investor money to pay fictitious investment returns to certain favored investors, to repay some investors and lenders in unrelated projects, and as her primary means of paying her personal expenses.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, charges Alexander with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Alexander has consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining her from violating the charged provisions; enjoining her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, and from engaging in activities for the purpose of inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any security, except for her own account; permanently barring her from serving as an officer or director of any public company; and providing that the Court to order disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and a civil monetary penalty, in amounts to be determined by the Court.\n\nIn a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Hampshire filed criminal charges against Alexander.

The entry of these final judgments concludes the SEC\u2019s litigation in this matter.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on September 28, 2023, alleged that from at least 2018 through mid-2019, O\u2019Donnell and Bozzo, along with other Pareteum executives, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to recognize revenue from Pareteum customers\u2019 non-binding purchase orders for SIM card services, despite knowing that the customers had not committed to paying for the services and that the SIM cards had not yet been shipped. This misconduct allowed Pareteum to materially overstate its revenue by $12 million \u2013 or 60 percent \u2013 for fiscal year 2018 and by $27 million \u2013 or 91 percent \u2013 for the first and second quarters of 2019 combined in its financial statements filed with the SEC. The SEC\u2019s complaint charged O\u2019Donnell and Bozzo with violating\u00a0 Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charged O\u2019Donnell with violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, as well as with aiding and abetting Pareteum\u2019s violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.\n\nIn a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York filed criminal charges against Bozzo and O\u2019Donnell. On May 22, 2024, both pleaded guilty. On August 26, 2024, Bozzo was sentenced to a prison term of one year and one day, and was ordered to pay forfeiture of $225,000. On October 9, 2024, O\u2019Donnell was also sentenced to a prison term of one year and one day, and was ordered to pay forfeiture of $60,000.\n\nBozzo and O\u2019Donnell consented to entries of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, prohibiting them from serving as officers or directors of publicly traded companies, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of $225,000 and $60,000, respectively, which shall be deemed satisfied by the forfeiture ordered against them in the parallel criminal proceedings.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Megan Ryan under the supervision of Julia C.

Fla. filed Sept. 23, 2024)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgments in Penny-Stock Fraud Scheme\n\n\n\nOn June 11, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained final judgments against defendants Benjamin Ballout and Mohamed Zayed for their roles in a fraudulent scheme to pump and dump the publicly traded stock of Enerkon Solar International, Inc.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleged, among other things, that Ballout inflated Enerkon\u2019s stock prices primarily through false and misleading statements and omissions in public statements and disclosures to investors. As alleged, with Ballout\u2019s help, William Fielding and Zayed then profited from the scheme through the conversion of a bogus promissory note to Enerkon stock, which Fielding sold to a third party at inflated prices.\n\nOn November 19, 2024, the Court previously entered a final judgment by consent against William Fielding. The entry of the final judgments against Ballout and Zayed resolves all claims arising out of the SEC\u2019s complaint in this matter.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all claims against Ballout and Zayed. On June 11, 2025, the Court entered the final judgments against Ballout and Zayed, ordering: (a)Ballout and Zayed to each pay a civil penalty of $460,928; and (b) Zayed to pay disgorgement of $96,000 plus prejudgment interest of $25,288.33. The final judgments also permanently enjoined (a) Ballout and Zayed from future violations of the antifraud provisions that they violated under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; (b) Ballout and Zayed from participating in an offering of penny stock; and (c) Ballout from serving as an officer or director of a public company.\n\nThe litigation was led by Pat Disbennett and supervised by Keefe Bernstein of the SEC\u2019s Fort Worth Regional Office.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Benjamin Ballout\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Mohamed Zayed\n  \n\n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

(\u201cBrite USA\u201d). In November 2023, the Commission charged Brite USA with failing to comply with Commission requirements for the safekeeping of client assets and for failing to disclose material risks and conflicts of interest associated with Brite USA\u2019s recommendations to clients to use a related firm in Australia as a custodian.\n\nThe SEC's complaint,filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleged that Brite USA advised onnearly $400 million of client assets maintained by Brite Advisors Pty Ltd. (\u201cBrite Australia\u201d), an Australian financial services company under common control with Brite USA. The complaint alleged that since 2019, Brite USA failed to comply with the custody rule requirement that it obtain an internal control report as to the safeguarding of client funds and securities maintained by Brite Australia. In addition, the complaint alleged that Brite USA breached its fiduciary duties to its clients by failing to fully disclose conflicts of interest and risks to client assets resulting from Brite Australia\u2019s borrowing of millions of dollars using Brite USA\u2019s client assets as collateral to provide operational funding to Brite USA and other related companies.\n\nBrite USA consented to the entry of a final judgment, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder, and imposes a conduct-based injunction that permanently enjoins it from acting as an investment adviser.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was handled by Travis Hill, Jonathan Grant, and Wendy Tepperman, and was supervised by Sheldon L.

Peter Scalise III and The3rdBevco Inc., Civil Action No. 2:25-cv-03088 (E.D. Pa. filed June 17, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges CEO and Beverage Company with a Multi-Million Dollar Offering Fraud\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Peter Scalise III and the New York-based beverage company he founded, The3rdBevco Inc., with defrauding investors by misrepresenting the company\u2019s business operations and use of investor funds. Scalise and The3rdBevco have collectively agreed to pay more than $1.1 million to settle charges.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, from October 2019 to May 2024, Scalise and The3rdBevco raised approximately $3.6 million from investors through the sale of unregistered securities based on materially false and misleading statements and other deceptive conduct. The complaint alleges that Scalise and The3rdBevco deceived investors about a potential collaboration with a celebrity on a new brand of rum alcohol. According to the complaint, The3rdBevco and Scalise characterized the celebrity as a \u201cglobal superstar and music icon,\u201d and used the celebrity\u2019s name, image, and trademark without authorization to promote investments in The3rdBevco. Scalise also allegedly misappropriated and misused over $850,000 of investor funds, including to pay personal expenses\u2014such as tuition, mortgage, and landscaping payments\u2014directly from The3rdBevco\u2019s bank accounts. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, The3rdBevco also repeatedly sold unregistered securities to the public without an exemption from registration.\n\nScalise and The3rdBevco, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, which would permanently enjoin each of them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and hold them jointly and severally liable for $856,461 in disgorgement plus $34,677 in prejudgment interest. The final judgment, if approved by the court, also would order Scalise to pay a civil penalty of $236,451; prohibit him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer or sale of securities, except for purchasing or selling securities for his own personal account; and impose permanent officer-and-director and penny stock bars.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Samika N. Osbourne, Polly A. Hayes, and Michael A. Cuff, with the assistance of trial counsel John V. Donnelly III\u2014all of the SEC\u2019s Philadelphia Regional Office. Julia C. Green, Gregory R. Bockin, and Scott A.

Cal. filed June 4, 2025)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Investment Adviser Charged with Misappropriating Client Funds\n\nOn June 11, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained final judgments against Santa Barbara, California-based investment adviser, El Capitan Advisors, Inc., and its principal, Andrew Daniel Nash, who the Commission charged with misappropriating $15.3 million from an advisory client to whom they owed a fiduciary duty.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on June 4, 2025 in the Central District of California, alleged that, in June 2021, Nash and El Capitan entered into an agreement with a public company advisory client to provide cash management services for tens of millions of dollars of the client\u2019s money held at various financial institutions. In reality, according to the SEC\u2019s complaint, in breach of his and El Capitan\u2019s fiduciary duties as investment advisers, Nash transferred over $15 million out of the client\u2019s accounts and spent a portion of that money to buy a $4.6 million home in Santa Barbara, California. The complaint further alleged that, to conceal his theft, Nash fabricated account statements purporting to show the client\u2019s money still held at the financial institutions. Additionally, according to the complaint, Nash filed Form ADV reports with the SEC that materially overstated El Capitan\u2019s assets under management.\n\nNash and El Capitan, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 by committing or engaging in specified actions or activities relevant to those provisions. The final judgments also orders (i) Nash to disgorge ill-gotten gains of $4.6 million plus prejudgment interest of $791,153.48; (ii) El Capitan to disgorge ill-gotten gains of $10.7 million plus prejudgment interest of $1,840,291.82; and (iii) Nash to pay a civil penalty of $3,456,942.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by William M.

Vanderbilt, No. 25-civ-4994 (S.D.N.Y. filed June 13, 2025)\n\nSEC Charges Former Executive Chairman of Public Company with Defrauding Investors through False and Misleading Statements\n\n\n\nOn June 13, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Roderick Vanderbilt with participating in a scheme to defraud investors in Vinco Ventures, Inc., a publicly traded, purported digital media and content technologies company.\n\nAccording to the complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Vanderbilt engaged in a scheme to defraud the investing public by making material misrepresentations in SEC filings and diverting Vinco\u2019s corporate assets to his long-time business associate and former romantic partner, Theodore J. Farnsworth, for his and Farnsworth\u2019s personal benefit. As alleged, although Farnsworth did not have a public-facing role at Vinco, he secretly controlled the company. In October 2021, Vanderbilt, hand-selected by Farnsworth, joined Vinco\u2019s Board of Directors. Vanderbilt then allegedly participated in the scheme by signing SEC filings, including proxy statements and proxy soliciting materials, that contained materially false and misleading statements. Specifically, according to the complaint, Vanderbilt signed filings that identified the officers and directors of Vinco but failed to disclose Farnsworth\u2019s involvement in Vinco\u2019s management. In addition, the complaint alleges that Vanderbilt signed SEC filings that materially misrepresented the operational status of key components of Vinco\u2019s business and their potential to generate revenue for Vinco.\n\nVanderbilt consented to a bifurcated settlement, subject to court approval, which provides for permanent injunctive relief against future violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14a-9 thereunder. The judgment also imposes an officer and director bar. In addition, the SEC\u2019s complaint seeks disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil penalties, which will be determined by the court at a later date, upon motion of the SEC. The Commission previously charged Farnsworth for his conduct in connection with the scheme.\n\nIn a parallel criminal action filed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida, Vanderbilt pleaded guilty to the same unlawful conduct alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint.\n\nThe SEC's ongoing investigation is being conducted by Jordan Baker, Elizabeth Butler, and Tian Wen, under the supervision of Alison T. Conn and Thomas P. Smith, Jr., all of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Travis Hill and supervised by Daniel Loss.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Sergio Damian Lopez, No. 2:25-cv-04795-CAS-AJR (C.D. Cal. filed May 28, 2025)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Canadian Resident for Involvement in Scheme to Fraudulently Promote Securities\n\nOn June 12, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against Sergio Damian Lopez, a Canadian resident, for charges related to his involvement in a fraudulent scheme to promote securities offered pursuant to Regulation A, which, if certain conditions are met, provides an exemption to the Securities Act's registration provisions.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Lopez participated in the fraudulent promotions of the securities of Hightimes Holding Corp. and Cloudastructure, Inc. The Complaint alleges that Lopez\u2019s associate, William Mikula, authored promotional articles through his newsletter, Palm Beach Venture, that falsely represented that neither the newsletter nor the authors received any compensation for their recommendations. As alleged, Hightimes and Cloudastructure actually paid Lopez\u2019s entities for the promotion pursuant to sham consulting agreements, and Lopez funneled a portion of these funds to Mikula. These actions gave investors the misleading impression that the recommendations were objective.\n\nThis is the third set of actions that the SEC has filed in connection with this scheme. In September 2022, the SEC filed a complaint against Mikula, alleging that he promoted securities, including for Hightimes and Cloudastructure, without disclosing his compensation. In September 2023, the SEC filed settled actions against Hightimes, its Chairman of the Board, Adam Levin, Cloudastructure, and Cloudastructure\u2019s CEO, Rick Bentley, for their involvement in the scheme.\n\nLopez, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933. The final judgment also enjoins him from certain promotional activities, orders him to pay disgorgement of $200,000 and prejudgment interest of $8,124.59, a penalty of $115,231, and prohibits him from serving as an officer and director of a public company for three years.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Sarah Nilson, with assistance from Charles Canter and Dora Zaldivar, and supervised by Finola Manvelian, all of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            SEC Complaint \n  \n\n              \n            Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Brady Jack Speers, Chatree Thiranon, and GHAP, LLC d/b/a Blue Star Texas, No. 4:23-cv-00905-P (N.D. Tex. filed Aug. 31, 2023)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgments Against Recidivist and Others in $8 million Real Estate Offering Fraud\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the conclusion of litigation against Brady Jack Speers, Chatree \u201cBen\u201d Thiranon, and GHAP, LLC d/b/a Blue Star Texas (\u201cBlue Star\u201d) based on their fraudulent house-flipping scheme that raised almost $8 million from 40 investors through the unregistered sale of promissory notes.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleged, among other things, that Speers, Thiranon, and Blue Star, a company they owned and controlled, raised funds by misrepresenting and omitting material information. \u00a0The SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that Blue Star told investors that their funds were secured by property interests in the real estate assets underlying the investments, when, in reality, Blue Star only secured investor interests in isolated instances and sometimes never even held title to the properties at issue. \u00a0The SEC also alleged that Blue Star rolled over investor funds to other projects without investor authorization. \u00a0Additionally, the complaint alleged that Blue Star touted Speers\u2019s success as a businessman without also disclosing that the SEC charged him with violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws in 2015 and that he filed for personal bankruptcy on two separate occasions.\n\nOn June 2, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas entered final judgments by agreement against Speers, Thiranon, and Blue Star, ordering: (a) Speers and Blue Star to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $2,506,301, plus prejudgment interest of $240,320.82; (b) Thiranon to pay disgorgement of $415,723 plus prejudgment interest of $39,862.28; (c) Blue Star to pay a civil penalty of $1,152,314; (d) Speers to pay a civil penalty of $691,392; and (e) Thiranon to pay a civil penalty of $230,464. \u00a0The final judgments reiterated injunctive relief included in prior judgments entered by the Court on September 20, 2023, that (a) permanently enjoined Speers, Thiranon, and Blue Star from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act; (b) permanently enjoined Speers and Thiranon from directly or indirectly, including, but not limited to, through any entity owned or controlled by them, participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security; provided, however, that such injunction shall not prevent them from purchasing or selling securities listed on a national securities exchange for their own personal accounts; and (c) permanently enjoined Speers and Thiranon from serving as an officer or director of a public company.\n\nThe case was litigated by Jason P.

Cal. filed Sept. 14, 2023)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgments Against NDB, Inc. and Nima Golsharifi for Fraudulent Statements in Press Release\n\n\n\nOn June 9, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered final judgments against defendants NDB, Inc. and its CEO, Nima Golsharifi, who were charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with conducting an offering fraud by making materially false and misleading statements in a company press release.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on September 14, 2023, alleged that NDB is a private startup company formerly based in San Francisco, California, that is purportedly developing a nuclear-based battery. NDB and Golsharifi allegedly raised over $1.2 million from investors after falsely claiming in an August 25, 2020 press release that NDB had successfully tested its battery technology at two preeminent laboratories in the United States and United Kingdom, and that NDB had signed its first two beta customers. The SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that these claims were false and misleading because NDB had not tested its battery technology at either laboratory and NDB had not signed any beta customers at the time of the press release.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, NDB and Golsharifi consented to the entry of the final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgments also order NDB to pay a $200,000 civil penalty; order Golsharifi to pay a $100,000 civil penalty; bar Golsharifi from acting as an officer or director of a public company for a period of two years; and prohibit Golsharifi from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security for a period of two years, other than purchasing or selling securities for his own personal accounts.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by Silvana A.

On September 18, 2024, the District Court denied the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss with respect to all but one of the SEC\u2019s claims.

Vladislav Kliushin, et al., No. 21-cv-12088 (D. Mass. filed Dec. 20, 2021)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Russian Defendant in $80 Million Hacking and Trading Scheme\n\n\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against defendant Vladislav Kliushin (a/k/a Vladislav Klyushin) for his participation in a fraudulent hack-to-trade scheme.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint filed on December 20, 2021, Kliushin and four other defendants engaged in a multi-year fraudulent scheme to profit by trading on material nonpublic pre-release earnings announcements of public companies that defendants deceptively obtained by hacking into the systems of two U.S.-based filing agent companies that assist publicly-traded companies with preparing and filing reports with the SEC. The complaint further alleges that, through the scheme, Kliushin and other defendants collectively realized at least $82.5 million in illicit profits.\n\nIn a parallel criminal case brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, Kliushin was charged and convicted by a jury of securities fraud and other charges for the same unlawful conduct alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint.\n\nFollowing his conviction, on July 26, 2024, the President of the United States issued Kliushin an Executive Grant of Clemency, commuting Kliushin\u2019s nine-year term of imprisonment to time served, and Kliushin was released from custody as part of a prisoner exchange among several countries. The Executive Grant of Clemency did not otherwise impact the conviction or orders of forfeiture and restitution in the criminal case.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s unopposed motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment against Kliushin. As set forth in the final judgment, the Court found that, by perpetrating the fraudulent scheme, Kliushin violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, both directly and through or by the means of his co-defendant in violation of Exchange Act Section 20(b), as well as by aiding and abetting his co-defendant\u2019s violations. The final judgment provides for permanent injunctive relief against future violations of these securities laws. Kliushin was also found liable for disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains resulting from the conduct alleged in the complaint, plus prejudgment interest, which shall be deemed satisfied by payment on the orders of forfeiture and restitution in the parallel criminal case.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by David Bennett and Diana Tani of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit with assistance from Darren Boerner of the Market Abuse Unit and IT Forensics staff Ken Zavos. Joseph Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, supervised the investigation. The Division of Economic and Risk Analysis provided substantial assistance during the investigation and litigation. The SEC\u2019s litigation was handled by Jennifer Farer and David Mendel, with supervision by James Connor. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, and the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Vladislav Kliushin\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Executive Grant of Clemency\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Unicoin, Inc.; Alexander Konanykhin; Maria Silvina Moschini; Alejandro Dominguez; Richard Devlin, No. 1:25-cv-04254 (S.D.N.Y. filed May 20, 2025)\n\n\n\nUnicoin, Top Executives Charged in Offering Fraud That Raised More than $100 Million from Thousands of Investors\n\n\n\nOn May 20, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged New York City-based Unicoin, Inc. and four of its top executives-CEO and Board Chairman Alex Konanykhin; Silvina Moschini, former president, former board chairwoman, and current board member; former Chief Investment Officer Alex Dominguez; and General Counsel Richard Devlin-for false and misleading statements in an offering of certificates that purportedly conveyed rights to receive crypto assets called Unicoin tokens and an offering of Unicoin, Inc.'s common stock.\n\nThe SEC alleges that Unicoin broadly marketed rights certificates to the public through extensive promotional efforts, including advertisements in major airports, on thousands of New York City taxis, and on television and social media. Among other things, Unicoin and its executives are alleged to have convinced more than 5,000 investors to purchase rights certificates through false and misleading statements that portrayed them as investments in safe, stable, and profitable \"next generation\" crypto assets, including claims that:\n\n\n\tUnicoin tokens underlying the rights certificates were \"asset-backed\" by billions of dollars of real estate and equity interests in pre-IPO companies, when Unicoin's assets were never worth more than a small fraction of that amount;\n\tthe company had sold more than $3 billion in rights certificates, when it raised no more than $110 million; and\n\tthe rights certificates and Unicoin tokens were \"SEC-registered\" or \"U.S. registered,\" when they were not.\n\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, Unicoin and Konanykhin also violated the federal securities laws by engaging in unregistered offers and sales of rights certificates. Konanykhin offered and sold over 37.9 million of his rights certificates to offer better pricing and target investors the company had prohibited from participating in the offering to avoid jeopardizing its exemption to registration requirements, as alleged.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Unicoin, Konanykhin, Moschini, and Dominguez with violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder.\u00a0The complaint also charges Konanykhin and Unicoin with violating the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act, and Konanykhin as a control person for certain of Unicoin's antifraud violations, pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Unicoin, Konanykhin, Moschini, and Dominguez, as well as officer-and-director bars against Konanykhin, Moschini, and Dominguez.\n\nAdditionally, the complaint charges Devlin with violating Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act by negligently making misstatements in private placement memoranda Unicoin used to offer and sell rights certificates and Unicoin common stock. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Devlin has consented to the entry of a final judgment providing permanent injunctive relief and ordering him to pay a $37,500 civil penalty.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Adam B. Gottlieb, Jason D. Schall, and Joss Berteaud and was supervised by W. Bradley Ney and D. Mark Cave. The litigation will be led by Russell Feldman and Mr. Gottlieb and supervised by Jack Kaufman.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

On May 4, 2023, the District Court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to its claims that the Pallas Defendants had violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the Pallas Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that order them to pay disgorgement of $5,396,629.54 plus prejudgment interest of $404,631.17 on a joint-and-several basis. The final judgments further provide for the following relief:\n\n\n\tSharma is permanently enjoined from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, was ordered to pay a civil monetary penalty of $90,000, and is barred from participating in any offering of a penny stock for two years.\n\tSalviola is permanently enjoined from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, was ordered to pay a civil monetary penalty of $90,000, and is barred from participating in any offering of a penny stock for two years.\n\tPallas Holdings, LLC is permanently enjoined from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and was ordered to pay a civil monetary penalty of $500,000.\n\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by David Zetlin-Jones, Eric Taffet, Daniel Loss, and Lee A.

The complaint also alleged that Ford was paid by other defendants to write favorable and materially misleading articles about companies without disclosing his compensation.\n\nMaza consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15d-1 thereunder, imposing an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar, and ordering him to pay a $578,095 civil penalty. Maza also agreed to be suspended from appearing and practicing before the SEC as an attorney and as an accountant. The order does not provide Maza an express right to apply for reinstatement. Ford consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of Securities Act Sections 17(a) and 17(b), and Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, imposing a penny stock bar, and ordering him to pay a $100,000 civil penalty.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Katherine Bromberg of the SEC\u2019s Boston Regional Office and Jon Daniels, Ricky Tong, and Michael Paley under the supervision of Thomas P.

Ripple Labs, Inc., Bradley Garlinghouse, and Christian A. Larsen, Case No. 1:20-cv-10832 (S.D.N.Y. filed Dec. 22, 2020)\n\nSEC Announces Settlement Agreement to Resolve Civil Enforcement Action Against Ripple and Two of Its Executives\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settlement agreement entered into with defendants Ripple Labs, Inc., Bradley Garlinghouse, and Christian A. Larsen that lays out a framework for resolving the Commission\u2019s civil enforcement action against them.\u00a0\n\nThe settlement agreement provides, among other things, that the Commission and Ripple would jointly request the district court to issue an indicative ruling as to whether it would dissolve the injunction against Ripple in the district court\u2019s August 7, 2024 final judgment and order the escrow account holding the $125,035,150 civil penalty imposed by the final judgment be released, with $50 million paid to the Commission in full satisfaction of that penalty and the remainder paid to Ripple. The Settlement Agreement further provides that, following an indication from the district court that it would dissolve the injunction and release the escrowed penalty amounts as requested, the Commission and Ripple will seek a limited remand to the district court for that relief, after which they would move to dismiss their respective appeals from the final judgment, which are currently pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Commission and the defendants filed the settlement agreement with the district court as part of their joint request for an indictive ruling.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s decision to exercise its discretion and seek a resolution of this pending enforcement action rests on its judgment that such resolution will facilitate the Commission\u2019s ongoing efforts to reform and renew its regulatory approach to the crypto industry, not on any assessment of the merits of the claims alleged in the action. Furthermore, the Commission\u2019s decision to resolve this enforcement action does not necessarily reflect the Commission\u2019s position on any other case.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            Settlement Agreement\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Nev. filed June 15, 2022)\n\nSEC Obtains Judgment Against \"Millionaire Maker\" Author who Sold Securities in Unregistered Oil and Gas Offerings\n\nOn April 29, 2025, the United States District Court for the District of Nevada entered a final judgment against Loral L. Langemeier and her company, Live Out Loud, Inc. (\u201cLOL\u201d), for selling securities in unregistered offerings, acting as unregistered brokers, and breaching their fiduciary duties as investment advisers by failing to disclose financial conflicts of interest to clients.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleged that, from at least 2016 through 2018, Langemeier held herself out as a financial expert and, through LOL, developed a roster of clients\u2014mainly small business owners and retirees\u2014who paid fees in exchange for Langemeier's supposedly objective financial advice. \u00a0As stated in the complaint, Langemeier allegedly convinced many of these clients to liquidate relatively conservative investments, transfer their funds to self-directed IRAs, and purchase securities in risky and unregistered oil and gas securities offerings.\u00a0 The complaint further alleged that Langemeier received hundreds of thousands of dollars in undisclosed compensation in the form of sales commissions when her clients purchased the oil and gas securities, and that she held undisclosed equity interests in certain of the issuers of the securities.\n\nThe Court previously granted summary judgment to the SEC.\u00a0 On February 16, 2024, the Court found that Langemeier and LOL sold securities in unregistered offerings in violation of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933, failed to register as securities brokers in violation of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and failed to disclose financial conflicts of interest to advisory clients in violation of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIn its final judgment, the Court ordered Langemeier to pay disgorgement of $404,807, prejudgment interest of $121,302.28, and a civil penalty of $50,000, for a total monetary judgment of $576,109.28.\u00a0 The Court also permanently enjoined Langemeier and LOL from violations of the charged provisions.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Brian T.

Jenni Yoon Jeong Lee (a/k/a Jenni Lee or Yoon Jeong Lee) and Evergreen Property Developments LLC, 2:25-cv-00793 (W.D. Wash. filed Apr. 30, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Seattle-Area Investment Adviser with $2.7 Million Fraud Targeting Seniors\n\n\n\nOn April 30, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against Jenni Yoon Jeong Lee (a/k/a Jenni Lee or Yoon Jeong Lee) of Federal Way, Washington, and Washington-based Evergreen Property Developments LLC, which Lee controlled, for their years-long fraudulent scheme targeting elderly members of the Korean-American community.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from at least May 2015 to March 2024, Lee, through Evergreen and other sham entities that she controlled, solicited approximately $2.7 million from more than 33 investors. As alleged in the complaint, Lee used her family relationships and affiliation as a member of the Korean-American community to gain the trust of her victims. As alleged, Lee falsely held herself out as an investment adviser and misrepresented to her clients that she would invest their money through or in legitimate companies capable of providing returns. Instead of making genuine investments on her clients\u2019 behalf, the SEC alleges that Lee violated her fiduciary duties by investing her clients\u2019 funds with or in Evergreen or other entities she controlled and masking the reality that the entities had no genuine business operations and lacked any capacity to generate returns on the funds Lee raised.\n\nThe SEC also alleges that Lee, while acting as an investment adviser, recommended that some of her clients fund self-directed individual retirement accounts (\u201cSDIRAs\u201d) and obtained access to those SDIRAs through false or deceptive means, such as naming herself as an interested party or listing her email address on account applications. As alleged, Lee then used her clients\u2019 SDIRA funds, often without her clients\u2019 knowledge or consent, to purchase direct investments in Evergreen and her other entities in the form of unsecured promissory notes that Lee offered and sold. These promissory notes included, as alleged, promises to make yearly interest payments ranging from 1% to 7% and to return investors\u2019 principal upon maturity. Instead, as the SEC further alleges, Lee used all the funds she raised to either make Ponzi-like payments to earlier clients or to pay for her personal expenses, which included supporting her gambling habit.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, charges Lee and Evergreen with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and charges Lee with violating Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, including conduct-based injunctions against Lee, disgorgement, and civil penalties.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Adrienne Adkins, Leigh Coutoumanos, and John Lindermuth, under the supervision of Michael Brennan. The litigation will be led by James Carlson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Washington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Washington Department of Financial Institutions.\n\nThe SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of anyone offering them investment advice on Investor.gov. Investors can learn about the unique risks posed by self-directed individual retirement accounts as well as how fraudsters prey on seniors by reading the SEC\u2019s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy\u2019s investor alerts regarding Self-Directed IRAs and the Risk of Fraud and Spotting and Reporting Investment Scams Targeting Older Investors.\n\nAny person with information related to this matter should contact the SEC staff by sending an email to ENF-JenniLeeVictims@sec.gov.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Ariz. filed Mar. 28, 2025)\n\nSEC Charges Arizona Man and His Companies with Defrauding Investors in Cannabis App Investment Scheme\n\nOn April 24, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against David A. Spargo, a resident of Mesa, Arizona, and two entities in his control, CannaCloud, Inc. and D.A. Spargo & Co. LLC, who were charged with defrauding approximately 33 investors out of at least $1.65 million dollars.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, alleged that, from at least February 2021 to December 2021, Spargo represented to investors that he would use their money to fund CannaCloud\u2019s business, claiming that the company was developing an application that would give marijuana consumers the ability to access inventories of cannabis dispensaries and purchase cannabis products. As alleged, Spargo told investors that they would receive a 20% annual return on their investment. According to the complaint, rather than using investor funds to develop CannaCloud\u2019s business as represented, Spargo instead spent investor funds at casinos and on his personal expenses.\n\nSpargo, CannaCloud, and D.A. Spargo, without admitting or denying SEC\u2019s complaint, consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Spargo\u2019s final judgment also enjoins him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, with a carve-out for trading in his personal accounts, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,504,559 with prejudgment interest of $313,449, on a joint-and-several basis with CannaCloud and D.A. Spargo, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $230,464, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. In addition, CannaCloud and D.A. Spargo, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, each consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining each company from future violations and disgorgement of $1,504,559 plus prejudgment interest of $313,449, on a joint-and-several basis with each other and Spargo.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Heather C. Gorman and Maria Rodriguez in the SEC\u2019s Los Angeles Regional Office, with assistance from trial counsel Alec Johnson. The case was supervised by Assistant Regional Director Marc J.

Biogenic, Inc., Diagnostic Link Ltd, LLC, Vital Systems Ltd LLC, BioTek Holdings LLC, Tek Wellness Inc., Capital Care Management LLC, Susann Ashley Cargnino a/k/a Susann Ashley Walker a/k/a Ashley Walker, Zachari Alan Cargnino a/k/a Zach Alan, Julie Ann Youssef a/k/a Julie Ann a/k/a Julie Joseph, and Gary Youssef a/k/a Gary Joseph, No. 5:21-cv-12236-MFL-DRG (E.D. Mich. filed Sept. 23, 2021)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Six Michigan Companies and Four Individuals for Fraudulent Medical Device Scam\n\nOn February 20, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment ordering total monetary relief of over $17 million against Zachari Cargnino and Susann Cargnino of Michigan, Gary Youssef and Julie Ann Youssef of California, and six Michigan-based companies who were charged with conducting a medical device scam for at least three years that defrauded at least 55 investors out of over $7 million.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, the Youssefs and Cargninos used six Michigan-based companies, which the Cargninos controlled, to offer bogus investment contracts to buy supposed \u201cWorld-Class\u201d and \u201cLife Saving\u201d medical testing devices. The complaint alleged that the defendants claimed that the devices would provide passive income every time the device was used in a doctor\u2019s office. The complaint further alleged that the defendants made numerous false claims about the investment opportunity, including that the defendant entities manufactured the devices, the amount of passive return on investment that could be earned by investors, the entities' history of success, and the number of devices put into use by defendants. In fact, the complaint alleged, doctors seldom used the devices. According to the complaint, after investors bought devices and the doctors failed to use the machines, Julie Ann Youssef and Zachari Cargnino sent investors fake usage reports and falsely communicated to investors that payments they had received were derived from device usage and payments from doctors when, in reality, the payments came from new investor money. The complaint further alleged that the Cargninos used millions of dollars of defrauded investor money to buy vacation rentals, jet skis and a trailer, and three residential properties in Manitou Beach, Michigan.\n\nThe SEC filed its complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on September 23, 2021. Ultimately all defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, consented to the entry of judgment on liability and permanent injunctive relief against them for violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. All defendants other than Capital Care Management LLC also consented to the entry of judgment on liability and permanent injunctive relief against them for violations of the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. The Youssefs consented to liability and injunctive relief contemporaneously with the filing of the complaint. The Cargninos and defendant entities consented to liability and injunctive relief after the SEC filed its motion for summary judgment against them. The court entered judgments on defendants\u2019 liability while reserving judgment on financial remedies.\n\nThe court\u2019s February 20, 2025 final judgment granted the SEC\u2019s motion for entry of final judgment and monetary relief, and ordered defendants to disgorge nearly $8.7 million in illicit profits and prejudgment interest and to pay nearly $8.3 million in civil penalties.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Matthew B. Reisig and Karaz S. Zaki, under the supervision of Tim England. The litigation was handled by Anna Area and Daniel Maher, and supervised by David Nasse.\u00a0\n\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            SEC Complaint\n  \n\n              \n            Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Nova Labs, Inc., No. 1:25-cv-00539 (S.D.N.Y. filed Jan. 17, 2025)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Wireless Network Creator for Misrepresentations Concerning Network Users\n\nOn April 23, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment by consent against Nova Labs, Inc., the creator of a purportedly decentralized wireless network known as the Helium Network. \u00a0The Commission had charged Nova Labs with making misrepresentations in connection with its offer and sale of preferred stock in a private placement.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on January 17, 2025, alleged, in relevant part, that Nova Labs made materially false and misleading statements to prospective equity investors about prominent companies, such as Lime, Nestl\u00e9, and Salesforce, purportedly using, being current users of, or relying on the Helium Network when those companies were not in fact using the network. \u00a0\n\nThe final judgment only relates, and is limited to, the Commission\u2019s allegations in the complaint that Nova Labs violated Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 by making misrepresentations in connection with its offer and sale of preferred stock in a private placement. \u00a0The SEC dismissed with prejudice other claims alleged in the complaint. \u00a0The Commission\u2019s decision to exercise its discretion and dismiss such claims rests on its judgment that the dismissal will facilitate the Commission\u2019s ongoing efforts to reform and renew its regulatory approach to the crypto industry, not any assessment of the merits of the claims alleged in the action. \u00a0The Commission\u2019s decision to seek dismissal of such claims does not reflect the Commission\u2019s position on any other case.\n\nNova Labs consented to entry of the final judgment, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, which orders it to pay a $200,000 civil penalty. \u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by Emmy E. Rush and Christopher Colorado and was supervised by Judith Weinstock, Sheldon L. Pollock, Thomas P.

GPB Capital Holdings, LLC, et al., 21-cv-583 (filed Feb. 4, 2021) (E.D.N.Y.)\n\nCourt Grants Receiver\u2019s Distribution Request to Return Funds to GPB Capital Investors\n\nOn April 8, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted the motion of the receiver of GPB Capital Holdings, LLC seeking approval of a plan to distribute funds to GPB Capital investors.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, David Gentile, the owner and CEO of GPB Capital, and Jeffry Schneider, the owner of GPB Capital\u2019s placement agent Ascendant Capital, lied to investors about the source of money used to make an annualized distribution payment to investors. Investors were allegedly told that the distribution payments were paid exclusively with monies generated by GPB Capital\u2019s portfolio companies, but GPB Capital actually used investor money to pay portions of the annualized distribution payments. To perpetuate the deception, GPB Capital allegedly manipulated the financial statements to give the false appearance that the funds\u2019 income was closer to generating sufficient income to cover the distribution payments than it was. GPB Capital also allegedly violated the whistleblower provisions of the securities laws by including language in termination and separation agreements that impeded individuals from coming forward to the SEC, and by retaliating against a known whistleblower.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal court for the Eastern District of New York, charged Gentile, Schneider, GPB Capital, Ascendant Alternative Strategies, and Ascendant Capital with violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), and Jeffrey Lash with aiding and abetting certain of those violations. \u00a0The complaint also charged GPB Capital and Gentile with violating the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d) and charged GPB Capital with violating the registration and whistleblower provisions of the Exchange Act and the Advisers Act\u2019s custody and compliance rules. The complaint sought disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and penalties.\n\nOn February 12, 2021, the Court appointed a monitor, Joseph T. Gardemal III, to oversee GPB Capital. On June 13, 2022, the SEC moved to convert the monitorship into a receivership because of GPB\u2019s alleged breach of the monitor order. On June 7, 2023, the Court entered a partial judgment against Lash by consent in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. \u00a0On December 7, 2023, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s motion to convert the monitorship to a receivership, and on December 8, 2023, the Court appointed Mr.\u00a0Gardemal as receiver over GPB Capital and numerous affiliated entities. On December 3, 2024, the Second Circuit affirmed the Court\u2019s order converting the monitorship to a receivership. On January 17, 2025, Mr. Gardemal filed a motion seeking approval of a plan of distribution to return funds to GPB investors. On April 8, 2025, the Court granted that motion for disbursement of funds.\n\nThe litigation is being led by David Stoelting, Neal Jacobson, Kristin M. Pauley, and Lindsay S. Moilanen, and is being supervised by Sheldon L. Pollock and Daniel Loss of the SEC\u2019s New York Regional Office.\u00a0\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

The alleged scheme was intended to induce investor victims to purchase NexFundAI by creating the false appearance of an active trading market for it.\n\nCLS Global consented to the entry of the final judgment, which includes an order enjoining it from violating Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 9(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; an order to pay a civil penalty of $425,000, disgorgement of $3,000, and prejudgment interest of $80.39; and an order to comply with undertakings aimed at ensuring that CLS Global ceases doing business with United States persons or entities.

David Yow Shang Chiueh and Upright Financial Corp., No. 2:25-cv-01920 (D.N.J. filed Mar. 17, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Amends Complaint Charging New Jersey Investment Adviser and His Firm with Fraud and Other Violations\n\n\n\nToday, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on April 11, 2025, it filed an amended complaint against David Yow Shang Chiueh of East Hanover, New Jersey and his investment advisory firm, Upright Financial Corp., for misconduct and for investing more than 25 percent of Upright Growth Fund\u2019s assets in a single company over multiple years, causing losses of $1.6 million.\n\nThe SEC filed its initial complaint on March 17, 2025. The amended complaint continues to allege fraud charges against the defendants, but no longer alleges that Chiueh operated the Upright Growth Fund\u2019s board without the required number of independent trustees and misrepresented the independence of one in filings. The amended complaint removes a charge against Chiueh for aiding and abetting Upright Investments Trust\u2019s violation of Investment Company Act Section 10(a).\n\nIn November 2021, Chiueh and Upright settled SEC charges that they, as investment advisers to Upright Growth Fund, violated its policy by investing more than 25 percent of its assets in one industry between July 2017 and June 2020, committing fraud and breaching their fiduciary duties. Despite being ordered to stop this conduct, the SEC\u2019s amended complaint alleges, the defendants continued their fraud by violating the 25 percent industry concentration limit and making misrepresentations about it between at least November 24, 2021, and June 23, 2024. As a result, the amended complaint alleges that the defendants\u2019 decision to wait more than two-and-a-half years to sell the relevant stock resulted in losses of approximately $1.6 million to the fund and its investors.\n\nAdditionally, the SEC\u2019s amended complaint alleges the defendants engaged in further misconduct during this same period when the defendants failed to provide or withheld key information from the fund\u2019s board of trustees, according to the amended complaint, and they hired an accountant for the fund without the required vote by the board.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s amended complaint, filed in federal court for the District of New Jersey, charges the defendants with violating Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rules 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c) thereunder, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d), and Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). The amended complaint charges Chiueh with violating Securities Act Section 17(a)(2), Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and Advisers Act Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8(a)(1) thereunder. The amended complaint charges Chiueh with aiding and abetting Upright Investments Trust\u2019s violations of Securities Act Section 17(a)(2) and Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder. The amended complaint also charges the defendants with aiding and abetting Upright Investments Trust\u2019s violations of Investment Company Act Sections 13(a)(3) and 32(a). The amended complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Stephen Holden and Ming Ming Yang, and supervised by Lee A. Greenwood and Corey Schuster, all of the Enforcement Division\u2019s Asset Management Unit, as well as Debra Jaroslawicz, senior trial counsel in the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Jaroslawicz, Mr. Holden, and Ms. Yang.\n\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Amended Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Steve A. Smith, Jr. and Xtreme Fighting Championships, Inc., No. 1:24-cv-24802 (S.D. Fla. filed Dec. 9, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgments Against Sports Entertainment and Media Company and CEO for Fraudulent Scheme to Illegally Sell Stock to Investing Public\n\n\n\nOn, April 15, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained final judgments by consent against Florida-based Xtreme Fighting Championships, Inc. and its CEO, Steve A. Smith, Jr. In December 2024, the Commission charged Xtreme Fighting and Smith with engaging in a fraudulent scheme to sell Xtreme Fighting stock to the investing public illegally.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleged that the stock sales were illegal because Smith and Xtreme Fighting's in-house counsel controlled the stock and sold it in transactions that were neither registered with the Commission nor exempt from registration. As alleged, Smith and the in-house counsel hid their control of the stock to avoid legal limits on sales by insiders by issuing the stock to purportedly unaffiliated entities that, in reality, they controlled. The complaint also alleged that to further the scheme, in April 2022, Smith and Xtreme Fighting publicly filed an annual report falsely stating that Xtreme Fighting's financial statements were audited. Smith allegedly made the false filing because Xtreme Fighting's annual report was delinquent, which restricted sales of the company's stock in the over-the-counter market. Smith allegedly also issued two social media posts about the false filing. The scheme allegedly generated over $5 million in illegal proceeds, of which Xtreme Fighting received at least $436,000.\n\nXtreme Fighting and Smith consented to entry of the final judgments, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

CanaFarma Hemp Products Corp., et al., 1:21-cv-8211 (filed Oct. 5, 2021, amended complaint filed Nov. 28, 2023) (S.D.N.Y.)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgments Against Two Former Hemp Company Executives for Fraudulent Offerings\n\n\n\nOn April 10, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments against Frank Barone and Kirill Chumenko, both former Senior Vice Presidents of Sales & Marketing at CanaFarma Hemp Products Corp., enjoining them from violating certain provisions of the federal securities laws and imposing five-year officer-and-director and penny stock bars.\n\nThe SEC's amended complaint, filed on November 28, 2023, alleged that, in 2019 and 2020, Barone and Chumenko, along with CanaFarma and its two co-founders, Vitaly Fargesen and Igor Palatnik, raised millions of dollars from investors. While raising these funds purportedly to operate CanaFarma, Fargesen and Palatnik allegedly made misrepresentations to investors, including claims that CanaFarma was a fully integrated company that was processing hemp from its own farm, when in fact it had not processed any hemp and its products used hemp oil supplied by third parties. The amended complaint alleged that Barone and Chumenko, at the direction of Fargesen, made unsupported changes to CanaFarma's financial model in order to disguise an expected series of payments to Fargesen and Palatnik. Additionally, the amended complaint alleged that Fargesen and Palatnik - in some instances with the assistance of Barone and Chumenko - misappropriated at least $4 million of investor funds.\n\nThe SEC's amended complaint charged Barone and Chumenko with violating Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c) thereunder. Previously, on December 1, 2023, the Court entered consent judgments against Barone and Chumenko in which they agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of these charged provisions and agreed to officer-and-director and penny stock bars, the length of which were to be determined at a later date. The final consent judgments against Barone and Chumenko, entered by the Court on April 10, 2025, reimposed that permanent injunctive relief for violations of the charged provisions and imposed five-year officer and director and penny stock bars.\n\nPreviously, on February 21, 2024, the Court entered a consent judgment against Palatnik in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and agreed to permanent officer-and-director and penny stock bars. On November 14, 2024, the SEC voluntarily dismissed its complaint against CanaFarma. The entry of the final judgments as to Barone and Chumenko conclude the SEC's litigation in this matter.\n\nThe litigation was handled by John C. Lehmann, Rusty Feldman, and Lindsay S. Moilanen and supervised by Daniel Loss and Thomas P. Smith, Jr. of the SEC's New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Frank Barone\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Final Judgment -  Kirill Chumenko\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Ga. filed Feb. 16, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgment Against Leader of Scheme to Spread and Trade on False Rumors\n\n\n\nOn April 11, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia entered a final judgment against Milan Vinod Patel of Cumming, Georgia for his role in a scheme that spread more than 100 false rumors about public companies and generated millions of dollars in illicit trading profits. The SEC previously charged Barton Ross, Mark Melnick, Anthony Salandra, and Charles Parrino for their roles in this scheme.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint against Patel was filed on February 16, 2023. It alleged that Patel received fabricated rumors that he knew to be false from Ross, Salandra, or Parrino about material events, such as corporate mergers or acquisitions and disseminated the bogus rumors to his contacts at financial news services, financial chat rooms, and certain other financial news purveyors via instant messages. \u00a0The complaint further alleged that Patel\u2019s contacts then immediately disseminated the rumors further through their news services and in chat rooms and message boards. Patel also allegedly disseminated the rumors to Melnick, a host of a stock trading webcast, who shared them with his webcast subscribers. As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the circulation of more than 100 rumors between December 2017 and January 2020 caused the prices of the subject companies\u2019 publicly-traded securities to rise temporarily, which allowed Patel to sell his holdings in such securities and generate more than $1 million in illicit trading profits.\n\nThe Court\u2019s judgment permanently enjoins Patel from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and requires him to pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,125,263, plus prejudgment interest thereon of $395,309. In a parallel action brought by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, Patel pleaded guilty to criminal charges and was sentenced to eighteen months in prison.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Martin Zerwitz of the Enforcement Division\u2019s Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit and Jonathan Austin. It was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. The SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Damon Taaffe and supervised by James Carlson.

Dharma Teja Nukarapu, et al., No. 5:23-cv-00503 (E.D.N.C. filed Sept. 11, 2023)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against North Carolina Man and Entities He Controlled in Offering Fraud Scheme\n\nOn March 6, 2025, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina entered final judgment against Dharma Teja Nukarapu and two companies he controlled, SharkDreams, Inc. and D Dollar Inc., for their role in a fraudulent offering scheme.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, SharkDreams, a purported healthcare software development firm, and its CEO Nukarapu, a resident of Apex, North Carolina and India, fraudulently raised approximately $2.7 million from more than 20 investors through securities offerings from at least January 2018 to November 2019. They allegedly made multiple false and misleading statements to current and prospective investors in connection with the offer and sale of SharkDreams securities, including that prior investors had doubled their money in a year, that SharkDreams was valued at as much as $7 million to $30 million, that SharkDreams had customer orders for its products and services, and that SharkDreams had a large investor who would buy out all of its remaining shares to infuse capital. The complaint alleged that none of this was true. The complaint also alleged that, in 2019 and 2020, D Dollar, a company owned by Nukarapu, raised at least $650,000 from investors, and investors were told that the funds would be used for a purported D Dollar subsidiary; but Nukarapu allegedly misappropriated approximately $595,000 of those investment proceeds to fund SharkDreams operations and for his personal uses.\n\nThe final judgment permanently enjoins Nukarapu, SharkDreams, and D Dollar from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale or any security. The judgment bars Nukarapu from acting as an officer or director of a public company for ten years. The judgment also orders: Nukarapu, individually, to pay disgorgement of $333,490 and prejudgment interest of $90,108; Nukarapu to pay, jointly and severally with SharkDreams, disgorgement of $522,320 and prejudgment interest of $143,946; and Nukarapu to pay, jointly and severally with D Dollar, disgorgement of $52,020 and prejudgment interest of $12,212. Each Defendant is also ordered to pay a civil penalty of $300,000.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was supervised by Kevin Guerrero and Stacy Bogert.

Cambridge Investment Research Advisors, Inc., et al., No. 4:22-cv-00071-SMR-SBJ (S.D. Iowa filed Mar. 1, 2022)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Investment Adviser Arising from Undisclosed Conflicts in Mutual Fund and Account Recommendations\n\nOn March 19, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment by consent against Cambridge Investment Research Advisors, Inc. (CIRA), a registered investment adviser based in Fairfield, Iowa.\u00a0 The Commission had charged CIRA with failing to disclose material conflicts of interest and breaching its duty of care related to its recommendation to place clients in wrap accounts and its selection of mutual funds and money market sweep funds for clients.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint\u00a0filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa on March 1, 2022, alleged that since at least 2014, CIRA repeatedly breached its fiduciary duty to advisory clients by investing client assets in certain mutual funds and money market sweep funds that generated millions of dollars in revenue sharing payments to an affiliated broker-dealer, Cambridge Investment Research, Inc. (CIRI), instead of lower-cost share classes and investment options that would have yielded less or no revenue sharing. The complaint further alleged that CIRA converted hundreds of accounts to its more expensive wrap account program without adequate disclosure and without analyzing whether doing so was in its clients' best interests. CIRA also avoided paying millions of dollars of transaction fees as a result of its mutual fund recommendations and failed to disclose conflicts resulting from its investment adviser representatives\u2019 receipt of forgivable loans in exchange for maintaining certain asset levels and tenure with CIRI, according to the complaint.\n\nCIRA consented to entry of the final judgment, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, permanently enjoining it from violating Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder. The final judgment further orders CIRA to pay $15 million in monetary relief, consisting of $10,164,698 in disgorgement, $3,035,302 in prejudgment interest, and a $1,800,000 civil penalty, and to administer the distribution of such amounts to harmed clients. In connection with the final judgment, the SEC dismissed its relief defendant claim against CIRI.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by Timothy Stockwell and Jonathan Polish of the SEC\u2019s Chicago Regional Office and David Benson of the SEC\u2019s Asset Management Unit in the Denver Regional Office. It was supervised by Asset Management Unit Chief Corey Schuster, Associate Director Paul Montoya, and Assistant Director Jeffrey Shank.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Norman V. Meier, No. 1:24-cv-12602 (D. Mass. filed Oct. 11, 2024)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Massachusetts Resident in Multi-Million Dollar Securities Fraud\n\nOn March 13, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgment against Norman V. Meier in the SEC\u2019s action alleging that Meier orchestrated a years-long, multi-million-dollar international securities fraud.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on October 11, 2024, alleged that Meier carried out a securities fraud involving the offer and sale of several stocks to unsuspecting investors in both Europe and the United States. \u00a0The complaint alleged that, from June 2015 to December 2023, Meier received at least $7.9 million from over 180 European investors and three U.S. investors. The SEC alleged that Meier engaged teams of cold-callers in Europe who used fake names and solicited investments in companies created by Meier for purposes of defrauding investors, as well as soliciting investments in well-known companies to which Meier and his teams of cold-callers had no real connection. The SEC further alleged that Meier\u2019s victims wired funds to bank accounts in the United States that Meier controlled. As alleged, rather than investing funds as promised, Meier misappropriated money for his own use and to pay his overseas sales network to lure additional investors.\n\nThe complaint named as relief defendants companies controlled by Meier that allegedly received investor funds, including: Treuhand, Inc., Windeco Corporation, Texxon Oil Corp., and International Financial Services, Inc., a/k/a IFS, Inc., a/k/a IFS, Inc. d/b/a IRM, Inc.\n\nThe court entered judgments by default against Meier, Treuhand, Windeco, Texxon, and International Financial Services. The court enjoined Meier from further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. \u00a0The court also imposed a conduct-based injunction and an officer and director bar upon Meier. The judgment against Meier orders him to pay a total of $5,047,515 for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The court ordered Treuhand to pay disgorgement of $3,832,048 and prejudgment interest of $423,145, Windeco to pay disgorgement of $174,279 and prejudgment interest of $35,090, Texxon to pay disgorgement of $978,151 and prejudgment interest of $304,573, and International Financial Services to pay disgorgement of $690,328 and prejudgment interest of $334,244.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by William J. Donahue, Kerry Dakin and Rory J. Alex, and supervised by Colin D. Forbes of the SEC\u2019s Boston Regional Office. The SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by Michael C. Moran also of the Boston Regional Office.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

David Yow Shang Chiueh and Upright Financial Corp., No. 2:25-cv-01920 (D.N.J. filed Mar. 17, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges New Jersey Investment Adviser and His Firm with Fraud and Other Violations\n\n\n\nToday, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it has filed charges against David Yow Shang Chiueh of East Hanover, New Jersey and his investment advisory firm, Upright Financial Corp., for misconduct and for investing more than 25 percent of Upright Growth Fund\u2019s assets in a single company over multiple years, causing losses of $1.6 million.\n\nIn November 2021, Chiueh and Upright settled SEC charges that they, as investment advisers to Upright Growth Fund, violated its policy by investing more than 25 percent of its assets in one industry between July 2017 and June 2020, committing fraud and breaching their fiduciary duties. Despite being ordered to stop this conduct, the SEC\u2019s complaint alleges, the defendants continued their fraud by violating the 25 percent industry concentration limit and making misrepresentations about it between at least November 24, 2021, and June 23, 2024. As a result, the complaint alleges that the defendants\u2019 decision to wait more than two-and-a-half years to sell the relevant stock resulted in losses of approximately $1.6 million to the fund and its investors.\n\nAdditionally, the SEC\u2019s complaint alleges the defendants engaged in further misconduct during this same period when Chiueh operated the fund\u2019s board without the required number of independent trustees and misrepresented the independence of one in filings. The defendants also failed to provide or withheld key information from the board, according to the complaint, and they hired an accountant for the fund without the required vote by the board.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal court for the District of New Jersey, charges the defendants with violating Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rules 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c) thereunder, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d), and Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). The complaint charges Chiueh with violating Securities Act Section 17(a)(2), Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and Advisers Act Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8(a)(1) thereunder. The complaint charges Chiueh with aiding and abetting Upright Investments Trust\u2019s violations of Securities Act Section 17(a)(2), Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and Investment Company Act Section 10(a). The complaint also charges the defendants with aiding and abetting Upright Investments Trust\u2019s violations of Investment Company Act Sections 13(a)(3) and 32(a). The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Stephen Holden and Ming Ming Yang, and supervised by Lee A. Greenwood and Corey Schuster, all of the Enforcement Division\u2019s Asset Management Unit, as well as Debra Jaroslawicz, senior trial counsel in the New York Regional Office.

The entry of the final\u00a0 judgment resolves all claims arising out of the SEC\u2019s Complaint, filed on December 12, 2013, which alleged that the Parvizian Defendants defrauded investors when they raised over $22 million between 2007 and 2011 through an unregistered offering of interests in six oil and gas well drilling projects, and that Parvizian acted as an unregistered broker. The Complaint charged the Parvizian Defendants with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the Complaint charged Parvizian with violations of Exchange Act Section 15(a).\n\nOn October 6, 2021, the Parvizian Defendants consented, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, to a partial judgment resolving liability and deferring the imposition of remedies, if any, to be determined by the Court after briefing. That same day, the Court issued the agreed partial judgment. Thereafter, on March 1, 2022, the Commission filed its Motion for Remedies (\u201cMotion\u201d) against the Parvizian Defendants.\n\nOn January 28, 2025, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting the Commission\u2019s Motion in full. In addition, the Court entered a final judgment ordering the Parvizian Defendants to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $9,844,127, plus prejudgment interest thereon of $938,770.65, and civil penalties of $500,000, and imposed permanent injunctions against future violations of the antifraud, securities-registration, and broker-registration provisions of the federal securities laws identified above.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Jennifer D.

Mass. filed Mar. 14, 2025)\n\nSEC Files Settled Fraud Charges against Massachusetts Resident\n\nOn March 13, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Tewksbury, Massachusetts resident Jonathan Webb for defrauding investors in a securities offering that included low-income cemetery employees. Webb has agreed to settle the case and to pay almost $400,000 in monetary relief.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from at least January 2021 to August 2023, Webb solicited and accepted approximately $1.7 million from at least 34 people for investment purposes. As alleged, Webb falsely told investors he could double their money within a year by pooling it and investing in the foreign currency exchange market (Forex) and he guaranteed the return of the capital and any interest earned.\u00a0 For investors who did not have tens of thousands of dollars to invest, the complaint alleges, Webb helped secure personal loans that enabled them to invest with him.\u00a0 According to the complaint, Webb converted investor funds to crypto assets and transferred the converted funds to overseas brokerage firms that permitted Webb to invest in Forex using up to 500:1 leverage and an algorithmic trading program Webb purchased on the internet.\u00a0 The SEC complaint further alleges that Webb lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in investor funds using the trading program.\u00a0 Despite these losses, Webb allegedly continued to solicit and accept investor funds, falsely guaranteeing the return of capital and promising exorbitant potential returns.\u00a0 By August 2023, the complaint alleges, Webb had lost most of the investor funds he had received by investing in Forex.\u00a0 In addition, according to the SEC complaint, Webb used investor funds to pay back some earlier investors and misappropriated funds for personal expenses.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, charges Webb with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Webb has consented to a permanent injunction from violating those provisions, a conduct-based injunction, disgorgement of $250,753 plus prejudgment interest of $29,391, and a civil monetary penalty of $118,225. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was handled by Kerry Dakin, Jeffrey Olshan, Mark Albers, and Celia D.

Wis. filed Mar. 10, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Illinois Man in Fraudulent Securities Offering\n\n\n\nOn March 10, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint against Ronald Pallek of Lakemoor, Illinois alleging he defrauded at least 87 investors in a scheme that raised over $1.5 million.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Wisconsin alleges that, between February 2021 and September 2023, Pallek raised funds from investors promising to double their money within a year by investing in an Iron Condor options trading strategy. The complaint further alleges that Pallek misrepresented the risks of investing using the Iron Condor strategy and lied to investors that he had sufficient funds to cover any potential trading losses. The complaint also alleges that Pallek sent investors false account statements and used some investor funds to make Ponzi-like payments to early investors. In the fall of 2023, when some investors requested the return of their funds, the complaint alleges that Pallek falsely told them that his bank had frozen his accounts but later admitted to investors that he had lost the money trading.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, charges Pallek with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, the SEC submitted a consent to a judgment whereby Pallek agrees to be enjoined from further violations and to a ruling from the court at a later date as to monetary sanctions.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Scott Tandy and Larry Brannon and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, of the SEC\u2019s Chicago Regional Office. The SEC\u2019s litigation will be led by Christopher White.\n\nThe SEC coordinated the filing of these civil charges with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, which today announced a plea agreement with Pallek related to the same conduct alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Peter Stuart, et al., No. 8:25-cv-00761 (D. Md. filed Mar. 7, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Washington, D.C. Real Estate Developer And Twenty-Seven Companies With Negligently Misleading Investors\n\n\n\nOn March 7, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Peter Stuart and twenty-seven real estate companies he collectively operated as Outlier Realty Capital with misleading investors about how their funds would be used. The defendants have agreed to settle the charges, with Stuart and thirteen of the corporate defendants agreeing to pay a total of more than $3.3 million.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Stuart and the Outlier Realty Capital defendants raised at least $34.4 million from approximately 100 investors by selling securities in companies created to invest in real estate in Washington, D.C., Maryland, or Virginia, and by representing that investor funds would be used for specific real estate projects. The complaint alleges that, in reality, the defendants commingled more than $50 million of property-specific funds, including funds from investors, and used the commingled funds for other real estate projects and to cover corporate and overhead expenses such as salaries. The complaint also alleges that when some of the properties were sold, the defendants underpaid investors by approximately $1.47 million.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, charges the defendants with violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendants have agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges. The defendants have agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the provisions of the federal securities laws with which they are charged and to install an independent consultant to, among other things, reconcile the defendants\u2019 accounts and oversee the orderly sale of five properties. Stuart and thirteen of the corporate defendants have agreed to be jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains of $1,471,440 plus $159,936 in prejudgment interest. The same thirteen corporate defendants have agreed to be jointly and severally liable for a $1,471,440 civil penalty. Stuart has agreed to pay a $240,464 civil penalty, to a five-year bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to a five-year injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, except for his own account. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Christina Adams and John Higgins and supervised by Kristen Dieter and Mark Cave. The litigation will be led by Charlie Divine and supervised by Melissa Armstrong.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

George N. Demos, Case No.\u00a0 3:25-cv-00539 (S.D. Cal. filed Mar. 7, 2025)\n\nSEC Charges Former Biopharmaceutical Company Vice President with Insider Trading\u00a0\n\nOn March 7, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against George Demos, a former Vice President of Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance at Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc., for insider trading in advance of Acadia\u2019s March 8, 2021 announcement of negative news from the FDA regarding Acadia\u2019s supplemental new drug application to approve its Parkinson\u2019s disease psychosis drug to treat an additional psychosis.\n\nAccording to the complaint, in July 2020, the FDA accepted Acadia\u2019s application and told Acadia that, if no major deficiencies were identified, the FDA planned to communicate proposed labeling by March 3, 2021. The complaint alleges that the FDA instead notified Acadia on March 3, 2021, that proposed labeling would not be forthcoming due to deficiencies in the application. The complaint alleges that on the morning of March 8, 2021 Demos, based on material nonpublic information he had learned that made him increasingly confident that the FDA was not going to communicate labeling information, exercised nearly all of his vested Acadia stock options and immediately sold his shares. Later, after the close of trading on March 8, 2021, Acadia allegedly announced the FDA\u2019s March 3 communication, and the following day its share price closed about 45 percent lower than the closing price on March 8. The SEC alleges Demos avoided losses of about $1.3 million.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Demos with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Demos has consented to entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, prohibiting him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and authorizing the court to determine the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest he shall pay, and whether a civil penalty is appropriate and, if so, the amount of the penalty. The settlement is subject to Court approval.\n\nIn a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California filed criminal charges against Demos.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by L. James Lyman and Marisa Westervelt and supervised by Victoria A. Levin of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Charles Canter and supervised by Douglas Miller.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Acosta, No. 3:23-cv-00323 (M.D. PA. filed Feb. 24, 2025)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Pennsylvania Man for His Fraudulent \"Free-Riding\" Scheme \n\nOn March 6, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against Rey D. Acosta of Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, who was charged with conducting a fraudulent \"free-riding\" scheme in which he attempted to profit by purchasing and selling stocks without having sufficient funds to pay for the trading.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that, in January 2023, Acosta fraudulently made a series of transfers totaling $1.5 million into his brokerage account from a bank account that he knew lacked sufficient funds to cover the transfers and these transfers were subsequently reversed for insufficient funds. The complaint further alleges that prior to the reversal, Acosta purchased three different stocks for more than $120,000 and sold the stocks for a profit. According to the complaint, after the fraudulent transfers were reversed, the brokerage firm closed Acosta\u2019s account, preventing him from transferring out the illicit trading profits.\n\nAcosta, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, consented to the entry of the final judgment which permanently enjoins him from violating Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by committing or engaging in specified actions or activities relevant to such violations. The final judgment also permanently enjoins him from opening a brokerage account without first providing to the relevant brokerage firm(s) a copy of the Commission\u2019s filed complaint in this matter and final judgment, and requires him to pay a $15,000 civil penalty.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Jack Easton, of the Philadelphia Regional Office, under the supervision of Kingdon Kase and Scott A.

Peter Quartararo allegedly instructed investors to make out their checks to his father, Leonard, as well as to another private company.\n\nThe final consent judgment ordered Leonard Quartararo to pay $20,103.98 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon of $4,862.02. On March 23, 2023, the Court ordered a final judgment on consent against relief defendant Paul Casella in which he was ordered to pay $33,128.88 in disgorgement, payment of which was deemed satisfied by the order of forfeiture in New York v. Casella, No. CR-005124-21NA (Sup. Ct. NY). On the same day, the Court also ordered a final judgment on consent against relief defendant Lisa Eckert in which she was ordered to pay $46,600 in disgorgement, payment of which was deemed satisfied by an order of attachment in New York v.

Mass. filed June 8, 2022)\n\n\n\nCourt Finds in Favor of Two Remaining Defendants in Fraud Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that an enforcement action filed in June 2022 against six defendants has concluded with a judgment entered on February 6, 2025, in favor of the remaining two defendants, Roger Bendelac and Thomas Capellini of New York, after a four-day bench trial conducted in October 2024 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The SEC\u2019s claims against the other four defendants, Trends Investments Inc., Clinton Greyling, Leslie Greyling, and Brandon Rossetti, have been resolved.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s action alleged that Trends Investments, an unregistered entity in the business of selling stock to investors, and its personnel, Clinton Greyling, Leslie Greyling, and Brandon Rossetti, engaged in a scheme to defraud investors in private offerings and sales of shares of two publicly traded companies. The Commission alleged that Bendelac participated in the scheme by placing manipulative trades to create the false appearance of active trading in the stock of one of the public companies, and that his brother-in-law, Cappelini, provided assistance to the scheme and to Bendelac by giving Bendelac access to his brokerage account and funding it.\n\nThe U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts previously entered a judgment by consent against defendant Clinton Greyling on September 23, 2022, and final judgments by default against defendants Trends Investments, Leslie Greyling, and Rosetti on April 25, 2023. Following a bench trial against Bendelac and Capellini conducted October 15 through 18, 2024, the Honorable Richard G. Stearns, United States District Judge, issued findings of fact and rulings of law in favor of Bendelac and Capellini on January 24, 2025, and entered a judgment in their favor on February 6, 2025.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case was tried by David M.

In its complaint, the SEC alleged that, from September 2017 to October 2018, Grybniak and Opporty conducted an unregistered and fraudulent securities offering of crypto assets called OPP Tokens via an initial coin offering (\u201cICO\u201d), raising approximately $600,000 from nearly 200 investors. The complaint also alleged Grybniak and Opporty marketed the ICO by making material misrepresentations and omissions and engaging in other deceptive conduct, including exaggerating the number of users and growth of its online blockchain-based marketplace for small businesses, misrepresenting the nature of Opporty\u2019s purported partnership with a major software company, and claiming the ICO was \u201cSEC regulated\u201d and \u201c100% SEC compliant\u201d when it was not.\n\nOn September 24, 2024, the Court granted the Commission\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, finding Grybniak and Opporty had conducted an unregistered securities offering without a valid registration exemption in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act. In addition, the Court rejected Grybniak and Opporty\u2019s defenses asserting reliance on counsel and that they lacked fair notice of the application of the federal securities laws to the ICO.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Grybniak and Opporty consented to entry of the final judgment, which provides for permanent injunctive relief under Sections 5, 17(a)(2), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act. The final judgment also ordered Gryrbniak to pay a civil money penalty of $100,000, imposed a conduct-based injunction against him, and ordered both Grybniak and Opporty to comply with various undertakings.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Nick Margida, Eugene Hansen, Mark Oh, and Kendra Kinnaird, and was supervised by Melissa Armstrong and James Connor.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Francisco Abellan Villena, et al., No. 18-cv-4309 (PKC) (S.D.N.Y. filed May 15, 2018)\n\nSEC Granted Summary Judgment and Obtains Final Judgment Against Individual in $33 Million Fraud Scheme\n\nOn January 24, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the SEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment and ordered final judgment against James B. Panther, Jr. for his role in a fraudulent scheme to secretly control and inflate the price of shares of a microcap issuer, and then make millions by selling shares to unwitting investors.\u00a0\n\nThis finding by the Court resolves all claims arising out of the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on May 15, 2018, which alleged that co-defendant Francisco Abellan Villena (\u201cAbellan\u201d) masterminded a scheme where, aided by Panther and two other co-defendants, he hid his ownership and sales of Biozoom, Inc. shares by using sham purchase agreements, a network of nominees, anonymizing techniques, and other deceptive practices. Panther also helped facilitate Abellan\u2019s use of alleged manipulative trading techniques and carry out an extensive promotional campaign to artificially inflate Biozoom\u2019s share price. The alleged scheme culminated in the defendants\u2019 illegal sales of Biozoom stock, which netted over $33 million in unlawful proceeds.\n\nIn granting the SEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entering final judgment against Panther, the Court permanently enjoined Panther from violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws, ordered him to pay a $100,000 civil penalty, and imposed a ten-year bar on participating in the offering of a penny stock.\n\nThe SEC also previously obtained final judgments against the other three defendants. On November 27, 2019, the Court entered a default judgment against defendant Faiyaz Dean, a Canadian lawyer, in which he was ordered to pay a $160,000 civil money penalty. On September 11, 2020, the Court entered a default judgment against Abellan, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering him to pay a $15 million civil penalty. The SEC also obtained final judgment against Guillermo Ciupak, enjoining him from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.\n\nIn a prior action in 2013, the SEC obtained a court order freezing proceeds from the unlawful Biozoom sales. It subsequently obtained a default judgment and established a fair fund, which has returned over $16 million to harmed investors. The SEC previously obtained a judgment against Abellan for his role in another market manipulation scheme.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Daniel Maher and supervised by James Connor. The SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Jennie B. Krasner, under the supervision of Deborah A. Tarasevich.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Bryant, III, Bryant United Capital Funding, Inc., Arthur F. Wammel, and Wammel Group, LLC. The entries of the final judgments resolve all claims arising out of the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on May 15, 2017, and amended on January 26, 2018. The amended complaint alleged that Bryant and Bryant United fraudulently raised $22.7 million from investors based on false promises of guaranteed investment returns in the mortgage industry. The amended complaint also alleged that Wammel and Wammel Group operated a related $44.7 million Ponzi scheme that defrauded Bryant\u2019s investors and others. The amended complaint charged defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n\nThe district court\u2019s final judgments ordered defendants to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and permanently enjoined the defendants from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws identified above. Specifically, the court ordered: (a)Bryant and Bryant United to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $4,290,830.71, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $162,899.10; and (b) Wammel and Wammel Group to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $5,989,605.50, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $227,392.17. The final judgments deemed these disgorgement and prejudgment amounts satisfied by the amount collected by a court-appointed receiver and distributions to investors, and by the restitution of $9,103,088.12 ordered against Bryant in United States v. Bryant, No. 4:17-cr-00213-ALM-CAN-1 (E.D. Tex.) and against Wammel in United States v. Wammel, No. 4:17-cr-00213-ALM-KPJ-2 (E.D. Tex.).\n\nThe litigation was led by Jason P.

American Renal Holdings Associates, Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 1:22-cv-10651 (D. Mass. filed Dec. 6, 2021)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgments Against Three Defendants in Fraudulent Revenue Manipulation Scheme\n\n\n\nIn January 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgments against the remaining defendants in a case involving a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the revenue of American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. (ARA), a provider of dialysis services through clinics across the country. The remaining defendants were two of ARA\u2019s former Chief Financial Officers, Jonathan Wilcox and Jason Boucher, and ARA\u2019s former Controller and Vice President of Finance, Karen Smith. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York previously entered judgment against defendant ARA in case number 1:21-cv-10366.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s action alleged that, from 2017 through at least November 2018, the defendants improperly manipulated certain revenue adjustments to enhance ARA\u2019s financial performance. These revenue adjustments should have been used to reflect actual cash received from insurance companies for patient services and to update initial estimates of revenue that ARA expected to receive. As alleged in the complaint, ARA and the defendants improperly recorded these adjustments to hit targets on key financial metrics. The complaint further alleges that ARA used a revenue \u201ccookie jar\u201d that contained adjustments that should have been recorded, but were not recorded until the adjustments were needed to meet targets for the key financial metrics. The complaint also alleges that defendants Boucher and Smith created false documents to mislead ARA\u2019s auditor and prevent discovery of their improper accounting practices. In September 2019, ARA issued restated financial statements which, among other things, reflected that it had overstated its net income by more than 30% for 2017 and by more than 200% for the first three quarters of 2018.\n\nThe final judgment against Wilcox, entered on January 14, 2025, permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the requirements of Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13b2-1 and 13a-14 thereunder. The judgment orders Wilcox to reimburse ARA in the amount of $45,000 under Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and to pay a civil penalty of $45,000. The final judgment against Boucher, entered on January 28, 2025, permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the requirements of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rules 13b2-1, 13b2-2(a) and 13a-14 thereunder. The judgment prohibits Boucher from acting as an officer or director of a public company for two years and orders Boucher to reimburse ARA in the amount of $18,926 under Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and to pay disgorgement of $20,102, prejudgment interest of $8,924, and a civil penalty of $60,000. The final judgment against Smith, entered on January 17, 2025, permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the requirements of Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2(a) thereunder. The judgment prohibits Smith from acting as an officer or director of a public company for one year and orders Smith to pay disgorgement of $43,348.59, prejudgment interest of $17,106.82, and a civil penalty of $35,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case was handled by Jonathan Austin, John Bowers, Peter Lallas, Brian Palechek, Andrew Skolnik, Christopher Bruckmann, Pei Chung, and Stacy Bogert of the Home Office and Kathleen Shields, David D\u2019Addio, and Alyssa DiPaolo of the Boston Regional Office.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Jason Boucher\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Karen Smith\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Jonathan Wilcox\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Tex. filed Jan. 19, 2022)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment in Penny Stock Fraud Scheme\n\n\n\nOn January 31, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas entered a final judgment dismissing the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s claims against Phillip W. Offill, Jr. following Offill\u2019s death. The Commission previously obtained a final judgment against Offill\u2019s co-defendant, Justin W. Herman, who alongside Offill was charged with misappropriating and selling millions of shares of a penny stock company using forged documents and sham agreements.\n\nThe SEC filed its complaint against Offill and Herman on January 19, 2022, charging both with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder and Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint alleged that Offill and Herman orchestrated a fraudulent scheme to misappropriate millions of shares of stock of a microcap company that belonged to the company\u2019s former controlling shareholder and to then sell the stock and share the illicit proceeds between them.\n\nOn July 16, 2024, the Court entered a final judgment against Herman, permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security not for his own personal account. The Court also ordered Herman to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,117,325, which the Court deemed satisfied by the criminal restitution ordered in a parallel criminal case.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Derek Kleinmann, Carol Stumbaugh, and Ty Martinez and supervised by B.

Mass. filed Apr. 5, 2018)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Massachusetts Man Found Liable in Multi-Year Insider Trading Scheme\n\n\n\nOn January 30, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against defendant Charlie Jinan Chen after jurors returned a verdict in February 2020 finding that Chen engaged in illegal insider trading in advance of five earnings announcements of Massachusetts-based company Vistaprint N.V.\n\nThe SEC's evidence at trial showed that Chen knowingly traded in the securities of Vistaprint, an e-commerce company, based on material non-public information provided to him by a family friend who was a Vistaprint insider or the friend\u2019s spouse. According to the evidence, the information Chen received enabled him to purchase options ahead of several quarterly earnings announcements and profit from the resulting price movement. Chen traded both in a brokerage account in his own name and one in the name of his wife, and made nearly $900,000 from the scheme. The evidence at trial also showed that Chen lied to the FBI about his relationship with the Vistaprint insider.\n\nThe jury found Chen liable on all counts, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The final judgment against Chen permanently enjoins him from violating the same antifraud provisions of the securities laws and orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $892,827.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was handled by Susan Cooke of the Boston Regional Office.

Gramins\n\nOn January 28, 2025, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgment in a previously filed civil lawsuit that included allegations of fraud against defendant Michael A. Gramins, a former trader on the residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d) trading desk at broker-dealer Nomura Securities International (\u201cNomura\u201d) in New York. This settlement fully resolves the Commission\u2019s case against Gramins.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC complaint alleged that Gramins made misrepresentations and omitted material information to investors in order to generate additional revenue for Nomura\u2019s RMBS desk. Among other things, Gramins allegedly misrepresented the bids and offers being provided to Nomura for RMBS, as well as the prices at which Nomura bought and sold RMBS, and the spreads the firm earned for intermediating trades.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged Gramins with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 as well as Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.

Shuang Chen, et al., No. 1:19-cv-12127 (D. Mass. filed Oct. 15, 2019)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Trader in Stock Manipulation Scheme\n\n\n\nOn January 29, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final consent judgment against defendant Xiaosong Wang for his role in a stock manipulation scheme that generated millions in illegally obtained proceeds on the trading of stock in more than 3,900 publicly traded securities. The entry of the final consent judgment resolves all claims arising out of the SEC\u2019s amended complaint, filed on December 23, 2019 to add two defendants and eight additional relief defendants to the complaint originally filed October 15, 2019, which charged eighteen traders. The amended complaint alleged that the traders manipulated the prices of thousands of thinly traded securities by creating the false appearance of trading interest and activity in those stocks, thereby enabling them to reap illicit profits by artificially boosting or depressing stock prices.\n\nThe Court\u2019s judgment against Xiaosong Wang permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and finds him liable for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains of $1,041,084 plus $80,428.35 in prejudgment interest thereon, to be deemed satisfied by an order of forfeiture in a parallel criminal case against him and monies previously collected in the civil case. In the parallel criminal action brought by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts, on September 12, 2024, Xiaosong Wang pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349 and was later sentenced to 30 days in custody and ordered to pay forfeiture of $1,041,084. He was also ordered to leave the United States and return to China.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, the Court entered a final consent judgment against the sole remaining relief defendant at that time, Wannian Investment, Inc., finding Wannian liable for disgorgement of $4,121,754.65, representing the net profits gained as a result of the scheme that had been transferred to Wannian.\n\nThe Court earlier entered a final consent judgment against defendant Jiali Wang on March 27, 2023, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws described above, and finding him liable for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains of $7,750,000 to be deemed satisfied by an order of forfeiture in a parallel criminal action brought by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts.\n\nPreviously, on June 9, 2022, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for default judgment against sixteen defendants: Shuang Chen, Wenwen Du, Lirong Gao, Jing Guan, Tonghui Jia, Xuejie Jia, Honglei Shi, Lujun Sun, Huailong Wang, Jiadong Wang, Jiafeng Wang, Linlin Wu, Lin Xing, Yong Yang, Jiancheng Zhao, and Forrest (HK) Co., Limited, permanently enjoining each from violating the same antifraud provisions of the securities laws described above. The Court also determined that all of these defendants were jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains of $35,603,447 plus $5,989,769 in prejudgment interest thereon, and ordered each to pay a civil penalty of $2,000,000. Also on June 9, 2022, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for default judgment against relief defendants Weiguo Guan, Jingquan Liu, Rishan Liu, Weigang Yang, Jingru Zhai, Song Geng, Qinghua Ren, Jixiang Teng, Xiangjia Yang, and Xiuchun Zhang, ordering disgorgement individually in amounts ranging from $3,505 to $533,713, plus prejudgment interest, for a total of $1,512,333.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Andrew Palid and supervised by Michele T. Perillo and Joseph G. Sansone of the Market Abuse Unit along with Martin Healey of the Boston Regional Office.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Jiali Wang\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Xiaosong Wang\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Wannian Investment, Inc.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

The complaint further alleged that Rabalais would then tout that the Crystal World stock was about to registered with the Commission, stressing in email solicitations and website posts the importance of buying the stock before registration made it valuable. Yet, according to the complaint, no steps were taken to register the stock and, for much of the fundraising period, Rabalais and the companies did not understand how such registration was achieved.\n\nRabalais and the companies previously consented to entry of a partial judgment, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act; and further permanently enjoining them from participating in the unregistered issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security.\n\nOn January 28, 2025, the Court entered a final judgment ordering Rabalais and the companies to pay, jointly and severally, $1,468,556 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest. The Court also ordered Rabalais to pay a civil penalty of $223,229, and Crystal World and New Sports to each pay civil penalties of $100,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Michael Flanagan and supervised by Ivonia Slade.

Anthony Marsico, Arthur P. Pizzello, Jr., Robert Quattrocchi, and Timothy Carey, No 1:25-cv-005553 (N.D. Ill. filed Jan. 16, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Four Illinois Residents with Insider Trading in Stock of Cannabis Company\n\n\n\nOn January 16, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against Anthony Marsico, Arthur P. Pizzello. Jr., Robert Quattrocchi, and Timothy Carey for allegedly insider trading in the stock of Goodness Growth Holdings, Inc., a cannabis company now doing business as Vireo Growth, Inc., in advance of a February 1, 2022 public announcement that another cannabis company, Verano Holdings Corporation, was acquiring Goodness Growth in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $413 million. On the day of the public announcement, Goodness Growth's stock share price rose by nearly 42%.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleges that Marsico, Pizzello, Quattrocchi, and Carey unlawfully bought Goodness Growth stock based on material nonpublic information about the planned acquisition. The SEC's complaint alleges that Marsico learned, through his employment as an executive of Verano at the time of the conduct, that Verano was planning to acquire Goodness Growth, and that Marsico tipped this material nonpublic information to Pizzello, who then tipped Quattrocchi and Carey. Based on this material nonpublic information, Marsico, Pizzello, Quattrocchi, and Carey purchased shares of Goodness Growth stock in advance of the public announcement of the planned acquisition. The SEC's complaint alleges that based on their illicit trading in Goodness Growth stock, Marsico had unrealized gains of $661,549, Pizzello had unrealized gains of $124,456, Quattrocchi had realized and unrealized gains of $28,136 and Carey had unrealized gains of $9,260 at the close of the market on the day of the public announcement.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Marsico, Pizzello, Quattrocchi, and Carey with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks conduct based permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against them along with an order barring Marsico from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Pizzello and Quattrocchi have each consented to the entry of judgments imposing conduct-based injunctions permanently enjoining them from violating Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty in an amount to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the SEC.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Richard G. Stoltz and Rebecca Hollenbeck and supervised by Steven Klawans of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC's litigation will be led by Ashley Dalmau-Holmes and Timothy Leiman and supervised by Benjamin J. Hanauer and Eric M. Phillips of the Chicago Regional Office.

As alleged, Kelly Kabilafkas and his associates deceived Airborne's transfer agent and several broker dealers to have the shares transferred into Kabilafkas' and his associates' names, deposited in their brokerage accounts, and cleared for sale to the public. Also as alleged, Kelly Kabilafkas, through Airborne and its nominal CEO, co-defendant Jack Edward Daniels, spent millions of dollars on an advertising campaign that concealed that Airborne was a vehicle for Kabilafkas's fraudulent scheme. The complaint further alleges that during the campaign, the Kabilafkases and their associates sold their Airborne shares for proceeds of more than $22 million. At the same time, as alleged, Airborne raised approximately $22.8 million from unsuspecting investors through public and private offerings, while Airborne's materially false and misleading statements about the company were publicly available. In total, the Complaint alleged that the scheme raised nearly $45 million.\n\nOn September 12, 2023, the Court granted the Commission's motion for summary judgment against Kelly and Tim Kabilafkas, Airborne, and Daniels, finding they had engaged in a scheme to take undisclosed control of Airborne and carry out a \"pump and dump\" in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The Court also granted the Commission's motion for summary judgment for its unjust enrichment claims against two relief defendant trusts controlled by the Kabilafkases.\n\nOn November 26, 2024, the Court granted the Commission's motion for remedies and final judgment, finding Kelly Kabilafkas liable for over $44 million in disgorgement, $12 million in prejudgment interest, and $21 million in civil penalties. The Court also assessed civil penalties against Tim Kabilafkas and Airborne, in the amounts of $460,928 and $1,152,314, respectively, and also ordered them and the relief defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest on a joint and several basis with Kelly Kabilafkas. In addition, the Court permanently enjoined Kelly and Tim Kabilafkas and Airborne from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and imposed a penny stock bar against each of the Kabilafkases. The Court stayed the case against Daniels, pending the conclusion of the parallel criminal action against him.\n\nThe Commission's litigation is being led by Dan Maher and Nick Margida, with assistance from George Bagnall, Jennie B. Krasner, Paul Bohr, Bob Nesbitt, Jeffrey Anderson, and Avron Elbaum, and is being supervised by James Connor and Chris Bruckmann.

Knox et al.; Civil Action No. 1:18-cv-12058 (D.\u00a0Mass. filed Oct. 2, 2018)\n\n\n\nCourt Enters Final Judgment Ordering Relief Defendant to Pay Over $4.6 Million Based on Receipt of Fraudulent Proceeds\n\n\n\nOn January 29, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against relief defendant Raimund Gastauer, of Germany, who allegedly received approximately $3.3 million in proceeds from an international scheme that generated more than $165 million from illegal sales of stock of at least 50 microcap companies. The final judgment orders Raimund Gastauer to pay over $4.6 million.\n\nOn October 2, 2018, the SEC charged Michael Gastauer and six U.S.-based entities that he controlled, Silverton SA Inc., Wintercap SA Inc., WB21 US Inc., WB21 NA Inc., C Capital Corp., and B2 Cap Inc., (together, the \"Entities\") with aiding and abetting a microcap fraud orchestrated by U.K. citizen Roger Knox and his Swiss entity, Wintercap SA. The SEC's complaint alleges that Knox and Wintercap SA helped sellers of large volumes of microcap securities evade U.S. securities laws that restrict sales by controlling shareholders. According to the complaint, Knox used Wintercap SA to conceal sellers' stock ownership by providing them anonymous access to offshore brokerage accounts. Michael Gastauer allegedly used his six entities' U.S. bank accounts to disburse the proceeds of those illegal stock sales. In late 2017 through early 2018, Michael Gastauer allegedly transferred approximately $3.3 million of the proceeds to Raimund Gastauer or accounts held for Raimund Gastauer's benefit.\n\nOn June 3, 2022, the Court granted the Commission's motion for summary judgment as to the Entities and entered final judgments ordering, among other relief, that they pay over $15 million. On March 23, 2022, the Court granted the SEC's motion for default judgment against Michael Gastauer, ordering him to pay over $17 million.\n\nThe court previously entered judgment against Raimund Gastauer on October 7, 2022. Raimund Gastauer appealed that decision, and in February 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed that decision and sent the matter back to the U.S. District Court. After further proceedings, on January 29, 2025, the U.S. District Court again entered judgment against Raimund Gastauer, ordering him to pay $3.3 million representing the net proceeds gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint and $1.3 million in pre-judgment interest.

Poerio, Jr., For Insider Trading\n\nOn January 27, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against defendant Frank T. Poerio, Jr., whom the SEC had previously charged with insider trading.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on May 10, 2024, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleged that between November 2019 and May 2021 Poerio traded in the securities of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Inc., based on material, nonpublic information that he misappropriated from a Dick\u2019s employee in breach of his duty of trust and confidence to that employee. The complaint alleged that Poerio realized illegal profits of more than $800,000.\n\nPoerio consented to entry of a final judgment that orders him to pay disgorgement of $823,367, representing profits gained from the conduct alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, and prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $32,967.50. The final judgment further provides that the disgorgement payment is deemed satisfied by the criminal restitution ordered against Poerio in the parallel criminal action filed against him in United States v. Poerio, 2:24-cr-00104-MJH (W.D. Pa. filed May 10, 2024). The final judgment also incorporates the May 15, 2024, judgment against Poerio which permanently enjoined him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Jason Litow, with assistance from Max Clarke, Steve Rapkin, Derek Bentsen, and James Carlson, under the supervision of Kevin Guerrero, Stacy Bogert, and Mark Cave.

Laura and Anthony R. Sichenzio to pay over $8 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on September 7, 2018, alleged that, between 2013 and 2017, Laura and Sichenzio defrauded approximately 80 investors and misappropriated investor funds through sales of securities in a company that falsely claimed to have exclusive rights to a crude oil processing technology. In the judgments, the Court ordered Laura to pay $3,431,860 in disgorgement, $1,732,128 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $292,016. Sichenzio was ordered to pay $1,629,369 in disgorgement, $822,375 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $165,689.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged Laura with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the unregistered broker dealer provision of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. It charged Sichenzio with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Laura\u2019s violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder.\n\nThe Court had previously entered judgments against Laura and Sichenzio, in which they consented, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, to the entry of injunctions against future violations of the charged provisions, as set forth in the judgments. A final judgment was entered against the third defendant in this action on January 24, 2023.

Based on this information, Wong purchased 10,000 shares of NeoPhotonics stock ahead of Lumentum\u2019s November 4, 2021 acquisition announcement and generated approximately $62,000 in illegal profits.\n\nThe case originated from the SEC Enforcement Division\u2019s Market Abuse Unit Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious trading patterns.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Wong consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.

Luis Jimenez Carrillo, et al., Civil Action No. 1:21-cv-11272 (D. Mass. filed Aug. 4, 2021)\n\nOn January 23, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against United Kingdom resident Jamie S. Wilson for participating in a fraudulent scheme involving unlawful microcap stock sales. The judgment ordered Wilson to pay a civil penalty of $50,000 in addition to relief that had previously been ordered by the Court. Also, on December 5, 2024, the Court entered a final judgment against United Kingdom resident Justin Roger Wall for participating in the same scheme. The judgment ordered Wall to pay a civil penalty of $50,000 in addition to relief that had previously been ordered by the Court.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that, from at least 2013 through May 2019, Mexican resident Luis Jimenez Carrillo concealed the fact that he and others controlled the securities of numerous microcap companies whose stock was publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets. According to the complaint, Carrillo secretly sold millions of the companies\u2019 shares in violation of the securities laws, often after organizing promotional campaigns to encourage investors to buy the stock. Wall and Wilson allegedly worked with Carrillo to gain control of at least one company\u2019s securities and fraudulently sell them. The complaint alleges that, as a result of these actions, what appeared to be ordinary trading by unaffiliated investors was actually a massive selling of shares orchestrated by Carrillo, Wall, and Wilson, who were seeking to profit at the expense of defrauded investors.\n\nThe final judgment against Wilson permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the ownership reporting provisions of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, and permanently bars him from participating in offerings of penny stock. The judgment ordered Wilson to pay disgorgement of $28,107, prejudgment interest of $3,173.02, and a civil penalty of $50,000.

Joseph A. Padilla, et al., No. 1:23-cv-11331 (D. Mass. filed June 13, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgment Against Defendant in Microcap Fraud Scheme\n\n\n\nOn January 21, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against defendant Joseph A. Padilla in an action filed in 2023 alleging a fraudulent microcap stock selling scheme.\n\nAccording to the Commission\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Padilla knowingly enabled illegal stock sales by people who secretly held enough of the stock of various small publicly-traded companies to dominate the market for their stock. The complaint alleges that Padilla hid those individuals\u2019 identities by selling stock for them through offshore brokerage accounts that he controlled, but that he opened in different names. The complaint further alleges that Padilla traded in his own brokerage account and accounts of family and friends to manipulate stock prices in support of the scheme. Padilla also allegedly enlisted a stock trader at a registered broker-dealer firm to facilitate stock trading as part of the scheme. According to the complaint, the stock sales coincided with stock promotions or news announcements intended to gain investor interest.\n\nPadilla consented to a final judgment holding him liable for disgorgement of $3,139,685 and prejudgment interest of $20,975, offset by $3 million that the Court ordered Padilla to pay in a related criminal case. Padilla also consented to the judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also permanently barred Padilla from participating in an offering of penny stock and permanently enjoined Padilla from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security other than purchasing or selling securities listed on a national securities exchange for his own personal accounts.\n\nThe Commission previously obtained consent judgments against defendant Kevin Dills and four relief defendants. The Commission\u2019s case remains pending against two relief defendants. The litigation is being handled by Michael Moran, Kathleen Shields, Ryan Murphy, and Amy Gwiazda in the Boston Regional Office.\n\nFor additional information, see Litigation Release No. 25745 (June 14, 2023) and Litigation Release No. 25952 (March 20, 2024).\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Gabriel Rebeiz, No. 3:25-cv-00124 (S.D. Cal. filed Jan. 21, 2025)\n\nSEC Charges Technical Consultant with Insider Trading\n\nOn January 21, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed settled charges against Gabriel Rebeiz, an electrical engineering professor at a California public university, for insider trading in advance of a February 14, 2022 announcement that a subsidiary of Murata Manufacturing Ltd. would acquire Resonant Inc., a company in the radio frequency filters industry.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Rebeiz served on Resonant\u2019s Technical Advisory Committee and had access to Resonant\u2019s proprietary information, which impressed him and led him to encourage Resonant executives to sell the company. The complaint alleges that after several months of continuing to encourage a sale of the company, on January 19, 2022, Rebeiz called a Resonant executive, who allegedly made a statement to Rebeiz suggesting that there was an impending acquisition. The complaint further asserts that Rebeiz purchased 60,000 shares of Resonant stock the next day and purchased an additional 60,000 shares over the next few weeks. Following the acquisition announcement, Resonant\u2019s stock price increased by 257%, resulting in Rebeiz obtaining illegal trading profits of $360,673.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, charges Rebeiz with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the complaint\u2019s allegations, Rebeiz has consented to entry of a final judgment that enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, orders him to pay disgorgement of the $360,673 in illicit profits with prejudgment interest of $65,560.25, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $360,673, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment is subject to court approval.\u00a0\n\nThe case originated from the SEC\u2019s Market Abuse Unit\u2019s Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious trading patterns. \u00a0The investigation was conducted by Sara Kalin of the Market Abuse Unit, with assistance from John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit\u2019s Analysis and Detection Center and senior trial counsel Stephen Kam. \u00a0The case was supervised by Assistant Regional Director Diana Tani and Market Abuse Unit Chief Joseph Sansone. \u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). \n\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Arete Wealth Management LLC, et al., No. 25-civ-00616 (N.D. Ill. filed Jan. 17, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Arete Wealth Broker-Dealer and Advisory Firms, Their Chief Compliance Officer, and Several Representatives in Connection With Illegal Securities Offering\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Joey Miller, Jeff Larson, and Randy Larson, formerly dually registered personnel with Arete Wealth Management LLC, a broker-dealer, and Arete Wealth Advisors LLC, an affiliated investment adviser, for fraud, registration violations, and aiding and abetting Arete Wealth Management\u2019s recordkeeping violations. The SEC also charged Arete Wealth Advisors and its Chief Compliance Officer and General Counsel, UnBo (Bob) Chung, with various violations of the federal securities laws related to a coverup of the representatives\u2019 allegedly fraudulent conduct and other compliance failures, and charged Arete Wealth Management with recordkeeping violations.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s charges stem from a previously-described scheme in which Richard Dale Sterritt, Jr. and six others allegedly defrauded investors through a sham oil-and-gas company, Zona Energy Inc. The complaint alleges that from approximately October 2018 to May 2020, despite the fact that Arete had not approved Zona securities for offer and sale, Miller, Jeff Larson, and Randy Larson sold more than $8 million worth of Zona shares to many of their Arete clients and customers, a practice called \"selling away,\"which is prohibited by securities laws. The three defendants, as alleged in the complaint, tried to hide the sales by communicating through means not subject to surveillance by Arete, such as through personal phones and email. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Miller and Jeff Larson frequently made false and misleading statements to prospective Zona investors and, in return for their fundraising efforts, Sterritt sold them deeply discounted Zona shares.\n\nAccording to the complaint, after Chung and Arete management learned that many clients of Miller, Jeff Larson, and Randy Larson had invested in Zona, Chung and Arete ordered the three to obtain settlement agreements releasing the Arete entities and their management from liability relating to Zona. However, the settlement agreements ultimately signed by more than 100 Arete clients\u2014which Chung claims that he did not read\u2014allegedly contained false and misleading statements as well as an illegal broad liability disclaimer, that could lead a client to incorrectly believe that the client had waived non-waivable causes of action against the adviser, thereby further victimizing already defrauded investors.\n\nThe SEC also announced settled charges against Michael Sealy for allegedly acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in connection with his efforts to sell Zona shares in violation of Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d). Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings, Sealy agreed to cease and desist from violations of the charged provision, to pay a civil money penalty of $200,000, and to be suspended from participating in an offering of a penny stock for a period of 12 months.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charges Arete Wealth Advisors with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d), and with violating Advisers Act Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder. The SEC\u2019s complaint also charges Arete Wealth Management with violating the recordkeeping provisions of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4 thereunder. The SEC\u2019s complaint further charges Miller, Jeff Larson, and Randy Larson with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act and with aiding and abetting Arete Wealth Advisors\u2019 violations of the same provisions, with violating Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, and with aiding and abetting Arete Wealth Management\u2019s violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4 thereunder. The SEC\u2019s complaint additionally charges Miller and Jeff Larson with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Finally, the SEC\u2019s complaint charges Chung with aiding and abetting the violations of Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Advisers Act by Arete Wealth Advisors, Miller, Jeff Larson, and Randy Larson, and with aiding and abetting Arete Wealth Advisors\u2019 violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder.\n\nThe SEC seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties as to all defendants, and additionally seeks conduct-based injunctions, penny stock bars, and officer and director bars against Miller, Jeff Larson, and Randy Larson.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation is being conducted by Theresa H. Gue, Austin Thompson, Christopher Ferrante, Christine D. Ely, and Alison R. Levine under the supervision of Sheldon L. Pollock of the SEC\u2019s New York Regional Office. The SEC\u2019s litigation will be led by Oren Gleich and supervised by Preethi Krishnamurthy of the New York Regional Office.

Naufal Sanaullah, No. 2:25-cv-10165-FKB-KGA (E.D. Mich. filed Jan. 17, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Fund Executive with Making False Statements to Investors and Prospective Investors\n\n\n\nOn January 16, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ohio-resident Naufal Sanaullah, the former Chief Risk Officer and Chief Macro Strategist of EIA All Weather Alpha Fund I Partners, LLC (\u201cEIA\u201d), the investment adviser and general partner of EIA All Weather Alpha Fund I, L.P. (the \u201cFund\u201d), with making and disseminating false and misleading statements to investors and prospective investors about the Fund\u2019s risk management practices and his educational background. The SEC previously filed a complaint against EIA and its Chief Executive Officer, Andrew M. Middlebrooks, alleging that from at least mid-2017 to April 2022, EIA and Middlebrooks deceived investors in the Fund, including by making repeated false statements about the fund\u2019s performance and total assets; misused new investor money to make Ponzi-like payments to other investors; and that Middlebrooks also misappropriated investor funds for personal use. SEC v. Middlebrooks, et. al., No. 2:22-cv-11073 (E.D. Mich. May 18, 2022). The May 2022 action is currently stayed.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint against Sanaullah, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleges that from at least December 2017 through October 2021, Sanaullah solicited new investors and encouraged current Fund investors to invest additional money while making and disseminating false and misleading statements. In support of these charges, the complaint further alleges that Sanaullah misrepresented to current and prospective investors the Fund\u2019s risk management practices by claiming that the Fund had controls in place when it did not, and falsely describing his educational background by representing that he graduated from college though he did not.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charges Sanaullah with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement along with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Sanaullah has consented to the entry of an order imposing injunctive relief and an officer-and-director bar, and authorizing the court to determine at a later date the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Heather Marlow and supervised by Kimberly L. Frederick, both of the Asset Management Unit, and was further supervised by Nicholas P. Heinke and Jason J. Burt of the Denver Regional Office. Tracy Bowen of the Denver Regional Office also assisted with the investigation. The litigation will be led by Zachary Carlyle under the supervision of Gregory A. Kasper, Mr. Heinke, and Mr. Burt, all of the Denver Regional Office.

Miles, Maureen T. Wile, American Equities, Inc., and American Eagle Mortgage Management, LLC. The entry of the final consent judgments resolves all claims arising out of the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on April 27, 2022, which alleged that the defendants defrauded investors when they raised approximately $15.5 million in 15 private investment funds from 2007 to 2018.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged Miles, Wile, American Equities, and American Eagle Mortgage Management with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The defendants previously consented to judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws described above, and Miles and Wile further consented to be barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company. The district court entered judgments imposing these remedies on April 28, 2022.\n\nOn January 15, 2025, the district court entered final judgments ordering Miles, American Equities, and American Eagle Mortgage Management to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $1,876,115.22 plus prejudgment interest of $1,146,307.10, and a $230,464 civil penalty.

Mason, and his companies Rubicon Wealth Management, LLC and Orchard Park Real Estate Holdings LLC, with misappropriating more than $20 million from at least 13 Rubicon advisory clients.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from at least 2014 to 2024, Mason made unauthorized transfers of money from Rubicon clients\u2019 accounts to his own accounts and those of his entities, Rubicon and Orchard Park.\u00a0 As the complaint alleges, Mason used the money for his own purposes, including to pay country club dues, transfer it to other clients, and purchase a portion of a miniature golf course in New Jersey.\u00a0 The complaint further alleges that Mason forged clients\u2019 signatures, made numerous misrepresentations about what he was doing with clients\u2019 money, and concealed his fraud for years by providing fake account statements and tax documents.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, charges Mason, Rubicon, and Orchard Park with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Mason and Rubicon with violating Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\u00a0 Mason, Rubicon, and Orchard Park have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from committing future violations of those provisions and provides that the court will decide the amounts of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties at a later date.\u00a0 The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nIn a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Mason.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Laura E.L.

Eric Zhu, No. 3:25-cv-00054 (M.D.L.A. filed Jan. 16, 2025)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges New York Blockchain Engineer with Perpetrating \u201cRug Pull\u201d Fraud\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged New York blockchain engineer Eric Zhu with perpetrating a fraudulent scheme to defraud investors in the \u201cGame Coin\u201d token (\u201cGME\u201d), a crypto asset that was offered and sold as a security by Game Coin, LLC and its founders. As alleged, Zhu was an experienced blockchain engineer, who was hired to perform coding work for GME.\n\nThe SEC alleges that GME was offered and sold to the public through a crypto asset trading platform that facilitates the creation and operation of so-called liquidity pools for trading crypto assets. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, a person who deposits a crypto asset token pair (i.e., liquidity) into a liquidity pool receives liquidity provider tokens (\u201cLP tokens\u201d). The SEC alleges that, absent safeguards, the holders of LP tokens can, without warning, withdraw liquidity from a liquidity pool, sell significant amounts of crypto assets into the pool and cause losses to investors. Such trading behavior is commonly known in the crypto asset industry as a \u201crug pull.\u201d\n\nThe SEC alleges that Game Coin and its founders represented to investors in publicly-available social media posts that \u201cliquidity\u201d was \u201clocked,\u201d which in the parlance of the crypto asset industry, conveyed that LP tokens were \u201clocked\u201d and could not be used by the issuers or other insiders to withdraw liquidity in rug pull-like fashion. Yet, according to the SEC\u2019s complaint, as part of the mechanics of the offer and sale of GME, certain LP tokens accrued to a blockchain address under Zhu\u2019s exclusive control. As alleged, Zhu kept these LP tokens unlocked and used them to engage in a rug pull. In so doing, Zhu misappropriated crypto assets worth approximately $553,000 and caused a decline in the price of GME of approximately 12%.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, charges Zhu with violating the anti-fraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Zhu agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $672,992, and a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Alex Charap of the Division of Enforcement\u2019s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, and Sarah Belter-Pylant of the Miami Regional Office, with assistance from trial attorney Russell Koonin of the Miami Regional Office and analysts Sejal Bhakta and Nicholas Bohmann of the Division of Enforcement\u2019s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit.

The defendants have agreed to pay more than $1.36 million to settle the charges.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Tobia allegedly breached his fiduciary duty as president and CIO of the public company by tipping Lee in the Summer of 2021 about his company\u2019s plan to make an offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Spok Holdings Inc., after which Lee promptly placed trades to purchase Spok stock. When Tobia\u2019s company later issued a press release announcing the offer, Spok\u2019s stock price increased by approximately 26 percent. Within two days, Lee allegedly sold all of the Spok shares she had purchased, generating illicit profits of more than $262,000. In addition, while serving as a member of the board of the other public company, Tobia allegedly learned material nonpublic information about PFSWeb, Inc.\u2019s sale of one of its business units known as LiveArea. Tobia allegedly tipped the information to Lee, who purchased 60,000 shares of PFSWeb and sold those shares once the LiveArea transaction was announced. As a result, Lee made more than $166,000 in profit.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Tobia and Lee with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Tobia and Lee have both agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges. In addition to agreeing to permanent injunctive relief, Tobia has agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay a civil penalty of $785,020. In addition, Lee has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $576,955. The settlements are subject to court approval.\n\nThe investigation of this matter was conducted by Mariel Bronen, Kiran Patel, Oren Gleich, Elizabeth Baier, George O\u2019Kane, and George N. Stepaniuk of the SEC\u2019s New York Regional Office and was supervised by Ms. Shah.

The complaint further alleges that the scheme generated more than $1 million in illegal trading profits.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charges all seven defendants with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Ashford Inc., No. 3:25-cv-00082 (N.D. Tex. filed Jan. 13, 2025)\n\n\n\nAshford Inc. To Settle Negligence-Based Charges for Misleading Investors Regarding a Cyber Incident\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filed settled charges against Ashford Inc. for materially false and misleading disclosures to investors regarding a cyber incident. Ashford, a formerly registered issuer based in Dallas, Texas, is an alternative asset management company with a portfolio of strategic operating businesses that provides global asset management, investment management, and related services to the real estate and hospitality sectors.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Ashford learned in September 2023 that it had been subjected to a cybersecurity attack and ransomware demand by a foreign-based threat actor. As part of the attack the threat actor gained access to Ashford\u2019s servers and exfiltrated more than 12 terabytes of data which was stored on Ashford\u2019s internal computer systems and which contained, among other things, sensitive hotel guest information. In a quarterly report filed with the SEC in November 2023, Ashford indicated that it had \u201ccompleted an investigation\u201d and had \u201cnot identified that any customer information was exposed.\u201d Ashford made similar disclosures in two additional quarterly reports, along with Ashford\u2019s annual report filed with the SEC for the period ended December 31, 2023. However, Ashford knew or should have known that the exfiltrated data contained sensitive personally identifiable information and financial information related to guests.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, charges Ashford with violating Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ashford agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges, consenting to an injunction and an order to pay a civil penalty of $115,231, which takes into account Ashford\u2019s assistance to the SEC staff in its investigation. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Derek Kleinmann of the Fort Worth Regional Office and Arsen Ablaev of the SEC\u2019s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and was supervised by Kristin Pauley and Jorge Tenreiro.

William K. Ichioka, No. 3:23-cv-03093 (N.D. Cal. filed June 22, 2023)\n\nSEC Announces Final Judgment Against Fraudulent Investment Fund Founder William K. Ichioka\n\nOn January 8, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against William K. Ichioka, who was charged by the SEC with conducting a fraudulent offering through his investment fund, Ichioka Ventures.\u00a0\n\nThe complaint alleges that Ichioka fraudulently raised money from individual investors for Ichioka Ventures by claiming he was an accomplished investor, promising oversized returns, and guaranteeing investors\u2019 principal. In reality, though, as the complaint alleges, Ichioka was unable to pay investors the promised returns and used money from new investors to repay other investors. Also, as alleged in the complaint, Ichioka falsified a bank statement and other documents to create an appearance of success. Furthermore, according to the complaint, Ichioka misappropriated millions of dollars of investors\u2019 funds for his personal use, such as on luxury watches, cars, gambling, and a penthouse apartment.\n\nIchioka stipulated to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The final judgment also ordered Ichioka liable for disgorgement of $30,994,308.97 and prejudgment interest in the amount of $336,406.89, which were deemed satisfied by the order of restitution entered against Ichioka in a separate criminal proceeding against him. In addition, the final judgment imposed a conduct-based injunction as well as an officer and director bar against Ichioka.\u00a0\n\nIchioka previously pled guilty to criminal charges, including a charge for securities fraud, in a parallel criminal action brought by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California, United States v. Ichioka, No. 3:23-cr-00190. In that matter, Ichioka was sentenced to 48 months imprisonment, ordered to pay restitution of $31,330,715.86, and fined $5 million.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by John Han and Erin E.

(\u201cTOKI\u201d).\u00a0\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Caridi acting as Chairman of TOKI\u2019s board of directors, assisted TOKI, which had not previously been in the business of supplying Personal Protective Equipment (\u201cPPE\u201d), in issuing two press releases touting TOKI\u2019s successful pivot into being a PPE provider. The SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that the press releases did not inform the public that Caridi and TOKI had previously failed to deliver three million medical grade NIOSH certified N-95 masks to a Canadian hospital pursuant to a contract with that hospital. In addition, as alleged in the complaint, TOKI had an $11 million liability to the hospital, and Caridi had misappropriated over $1 million from the unperformed contract, which included amounts taken after he had already promised the hospital a refund that TOKI did not have the resources to pay.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Caridi consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoined him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; barred him from serving as of officer and director of a public company for seven years; barred him from participating in an offering of penny stock; ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $180,000; and ordered him to pay disgorgement of $895,972, to be offset in an amount equal to any payments Caridi makes to satisfy a judgment awarded against Caridi in a related private litigation filed by the hospital.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was led by Christopher M.

Tex. filed Sept. 20, 2021)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Former Austin, Texas Resident Who Defrauded Investors With Two Websites\n\nOn December 12, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against Leena Jaitley, formerly of Austin, Texas.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on September 20, 2021, charged Jaitley with operating two fraudulent websites, Managed Options Trading and Options by Pros, and offering to trade options on behalf of investors. To recruit clients, Jaitley falsely claimed that the websites employed experienced traders in New York who used a proprietary trading methodology with a history of success. In reality, Jaitley acted alone from Austin, Texas or with the assistance of her father. The SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that Jaitley\u2019s misrepresentations led to at least fifteen individuals losing more than $800,000 in principal. On January 3, 2024, the court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Jaitley finding that she violated multiple antifraud provisions of the securities laws.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, the court entered a final judgment permanently enjoining Jaitley from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The court also ordered Jaitley to disgorge $672,833 in ill-gotten gains plus $158,835 in prejudgment interest and pay a civil penalty of $672,833.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Charlie Divine and Zachary A. Avallone with the assistance of Donato Furlano and Peter Rosario and supervised by James Connor and Christopher Bruckmann. The SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Christian Ascunce and Greg Hillson.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Kirchner et al., No. 4:23-cv-00147 (N.D. Tex. filed Feb. 14, 2023)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Former CEO in $67 Million Offering Fraud\n\nOn January 3, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against defendant Christopher S. Kirchner, the co-founder and former CEO of Slync, Inc., a privately-held Texas-based software company, whom the SEC previously charged for fraudulently offering and selling more than $67 million of securities to multiple investors, more than $28 million of which he misappropriated for personal benefit.\n\nAs alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint filed on February 14, 2023, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, between approximately January 2020 and January 2022, Kirchner misrepresented the financial condition of Slync to investors, including the amount of revenue received from customers and the nature and volume of contracts with existing and potential customers, as well as the planned use of fundraising proceeds. In addition, between March 2020 and his termination from Slync in August 2022, Kirchner allegedly misappropriated more than $28 million of the funds that Slync raised from investors and used the money to, among other things, fund personal investments, pay entertainment expenses, and purchase a $16 million private jet.\n\nKirchner consented to entry of the final judgment enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and imposing an officer-and-director bar. The final judgment orders disgorgement of $28,074,080, representing Kirchner\u2019s ill-gotten gains as a result of the conduct alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, together with prejudgment interest of $6,770,535.02, but it deems the obligation to pay these amounts satisfied by the entry of the order of restitution in United States v. Kirchner, Crim. No. 23-127-P (N.D. Tex.), the parallel criminal action based on the same conduct alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint. The final judgment does not impose civil penalties in light of Kirchner\u2019s conviction and sentence of twenty years imprisonment in the parallel criminal case.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was handled by Todd Brody, Mary Kay Dunning, and Steven G. Rawlings and was supervised by Preethi Krishnamurthy and Sheldon L.

Amit Dagar and Atul Bhiwapurkar, No. 1:23-cv-5564 (S.D.N.Y. filed June 29, 2023)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgments Against Former Pfizer Statistician Amit Dagar and His Friend and Business Partner Atul Bhiwapurkar Who Both Traded Ahead of COVID-19 Treatment Announcement\u00a0\n\nOn December 27, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments against Amit Dagar of Hillsborough, New Jersey, and Atul Bhiwapurkar of Milpitas, California.\u00a0\n\nAs alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint filed on June 29, 2023, Dagar, a former Pfizer Inc. employee, and his close friend and business partner, Bhiwapurkar, traded in advance of the company\u2019s November 5, 2021, announcement that a randomized, double-blind study of its COVID-19 antiviral treatment, Paxlovid, was successful. Following that announcement in which Pfizer\u2019s CEO referred to the news as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in the global efforts to \u201chalt the devastation\u201d of the pandemic, the company\u2019s stock price increased by nearly 11 percent, the largest single-day price move in the stock since 2009. The complaint alleges that on the day before the Paxlovid announcement, Dagar learned material, nonpublic information about the success of the trial. The complaint alleges that Dagar\u2019s and Bhiwapurkar\u2019s trading generated approximately $214,395 and $60,300 respectively in illicit profits.\n\nThe case originated from the SEC\u2019s Market Abuse Unit\u2019s Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious trading patterns.\n\nDagar and Bhiwapurkar consented to final judgments in the SEC\u2019s case after a jury convicted Dagar, and Bhiwapurkar pleaded guilty, in a parallel criminal case, United States v. Dagar et al., No. 1-23-CR-00319-ALC (S.D.N.Y.).\u00a0\n\nThe court\u2019s final judgments of Dagar and Bhiwapurkar permanently enjoined each from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court\u2019s final judgment of Dagar also ordered him to pay disgorgement of $214,395 plus prejudgment interest of $41,908 and deemed Dagar\u2019s obligation to pay those amounts satisfied by the order of forfeiture in the parallel criminal case. The court\u2019s final judgment of Bhiwapurkar ordered him to pay disgorgement of $60,300, deemed satisfied by the order of forfeiture in the parallel criminal case, and a civil penalty of $60,300.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Market Abuse Unit staff, with the assistance of Patrick McCluskey of the Market Abuse Unit\u2019s Analysis and Detection Center, and was supervised by Paul Kim and Joseph Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit.

Dupont, Shawn P. Cronin, Stanley Kaplan, Paul Feldman, and Jarett G. Mendoza resolving the insider trading case filed against them.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on June 29, 2023 alleged that Dupont, who was then a vice president at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., tipped his close friend Cronin to confidential information about the acquisition of Portola Pharmaceuticals Inc. Cronin then allegedly provided the information to Mendoza and Kaplan, and Kaplan, in turn, provided the information to Feldman. The SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that Cronin, Mendoza, Kaplan, and Feldman used this material, nonpublic information to purchased Portola securities prior to the announcement of the acquisition. The complaint further alleged that Kaplan and Feldman passed information on to other family members and friends, who also profitably traded.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged all five defendants with violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. The defendants each consented to the entry of final judgments in the SEC action that provide permanent injunctive relief from the provisions charged in the complaint, as set forth in each judgment, and barred each from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company. Dupont was ordered to pay a civil money penalty of $36,000.\n\nEach defendant had previously pled guilty to criminal charges for securities fraud in parallel criminal actions brought by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, United States v. Dupont et al., No. 1:23-cr-00320, and United States v. Mendoza, No. 1:23-cr-00316. Cronin was sentenced to three months\u2019 imprisonment, ordered to forfeit his profits of $71,996.06, and fined $5,000; Kaplan was sentenced to five months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered to forfeit his profits of $472,053.61; and Feldman was sentenced to three months\u2019 imprisonment, ordered to forfeit his profits of $1,730,827.54, and fined $25,000. Mendoza was ordered to forfeit his profits of $38,648.58 and Dupont was fined $75,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation and investigation were led by Margaret Spillane, Matthew Lambert, and Alison Conn of the New York Regional Office, under the supervision of Thomas P.

Farnsworth, No. 1:24-civ-09911 (S.D.N.Y. filed Dec. 23, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges Recidivist for Defrauding Investors through False and Misleading Statements\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on December 30, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a consent judgment against Theodore J. Farnsworth for defrauding investors in Vinco Ventures, Inc., a purported digital media and content technologies company.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint which was filed on December 23, 2024, between at least January 2021 and April 2023, Farnsworth secretly controlled Vinco, in part through his control over certain Vinco officers and directors who Farnsworth hand-selected for their roles. The complaint alleges that Farnsworth sought to conceal his role at Vinco because he knew the SEC and the Department of Justice were investigating his conduct in connection with MoviePass, Inc., a movie subscription company, and its parent company, Helios & Matheson Analytics, Inc. (HMNY).\n\nAs alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Farnsworth intended to merge a private entity he controlled, Zash Global Media and Entertainment Corporation, into Vinco, and authorized the issuance of press releases and filings with the Commission describing the planned combination of Vinco\u2019s proprietary platform with Zash\u2019s state-of-the-art analytics and distribution technology. However, according to the complaint, Farnsworth knew neither Zash nor Vinco possessed the platform or technology described. The complaint alleges Farnsworth drafted, reviewed, or approved false or misleading statements concerning the operations of two affiliated companies that exaggerated, among other things, the affiliated companies\u2019 capabilities and Vinco\u2019s expectations of the revenue the affiliated companies would generate. As alleged, Farnsworth extracted from Vinco millions of dollars for himself through his undisclosed control of the company.\n\nFarnsworth consented to the entry of a judgment which provides permanent injunctive relief under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and imposes an officer and director bar. The SEC\u2019s complaint also seeks disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, which will be determined by the court at a later date, upon motion of the SEC.\n\nThe SEC charged Farnsworth in September 2022 for making materially false or misleading statements concerning MoviePass and HMNY. In that action, Farnsworth agreed to the entry of a judgment providing permanent injunctive relief under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, enjoining him from violating various other provisions charged in that complaint, and imposing a conduct-based injunction and an officer and director bar.\n\nThe SEC's ongoing investigation is being conducted by Jordan Baker, Elizabeth Butler, and Tian Wen, under the supervision of Alison T. Conn and Thomas P. Smith, Jr., all of the New York Regional Office. The litigation is being led by Travis Hill and supervised by Daniel Loss.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Theodore J. Farnsworth, J. Mitchell Lowe, and Khalid Itum, No. 22-civ-08226 (S.D.N.Y. filed Sept. 26, 2022)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgment Against Former Executive at MoviePass\u2019s Parent Company\n\n\n\nOn December 23, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a consent judgment against Theodore J. Farnsworth, former CEO of Helios & Matheson Analytics Inc. (HMNY), for making materially false and misleading statements concerning HMNY\u2019s subsidiary, MoviePass, Inc., a movie subscription service.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, between August 2017 and at least March 2019, Farnsworth and another defendant intentionally and repeatedly made misstatements in HMNY Commission filings, press releases, and in the press concerning key aspects of MoviePass\u2019s business model. The misstatements concerned HMNY\u2019s claim that MoviePass could be profitable at its new, $9.95-per-month subscription price; HMNY's purported data analytics capabilities; and HMNY's ability to fund MoviePass's operations. As further alleged in the complaint, Farnsworth also devised fraudulent tactics to prevent MoviePass's subscribers from using the service. In addition, the complaint alleges that, between January and April 2018, Farnsworth knowingly approved false invoices that a third defendant, a former MoviePass executive, submitted to HMNY and MoviePass, disguising bonus payments as services purportedly provided by an entity that the third defendant controlled. The litigation against the other defendants continues.\n\nFarnsworth consented to the entry of a judgment (i) providing permanent injunctive relief under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and (ii) permanently enjoining him from violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act. In the judgment, Farnsworth also consented to the entry of a conduct-based injunction and an officer and director bar. The SEC\u2019s complaint also seeks disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, which will be determined by the court at a later date, upon motion of the SEC.\n\nThe SEC's litigation is being handled by Elizabeth Butler and Tian Wen, under the supervision of Jack Kaufman and Thomas P. Smith, Jr., all of the New York Regional Office.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

City of Rochester, New York, Rosiland Brooks-Harris, Capital Markets Advisors, LLC, Richard Ganci, and Richard Tortora, No. 22-cv-6273 (W.D.N.Y. filed June 14, 2022)\n\nSEC Resolves Litigation Against City of Rochester, NY, its former Finance Director, and Municipal Advisor\n\nThe SEC announced that it has resolved all pending litigation in the action it filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York on June 14, 2022 against the City of Rochester, NY and its former finance director Rosiland Brooks-Harris, and against a New York-based municipal advisor, Capital Markets Advisors, LLC (CMA), and two of its principals, Richard Tortora and Richard Ganci (CMA Defendants).\n\nIn its Complaint, the SEC alleged that, in 2019, the City, Brooks-Harris, CMA and Ganci misled investors with bond offering documents that included outdated financial statements for the Rochester City School District (District) and did not indicate that the District was experiencing financial distress due to overspending on teacher salaries.\u00a0The SEC alleged that, in connection with the alleged bond offering conduct, the City and Brooks-Harris violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\u00a0 The SEC alleged that, in connection with the alleged bond offering conduct, Ganci and CMA violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act, and MSRB Rules G-17 and G-42.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Complaint separately alleged that the CMA Defendants failed to disclose to nearly 200 municipal clients that CMA had material conflicts of interest arising from its compensation arrangements. \u00a0The SEC alleged that, by this conduct, the CMA Defendants violated Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act, MSRB Rules G-17, G-42 and G-44.\u00a0 As previously announced, on April 15, 2024, the Court found that the CMA Defendants violated those provisions in connection with their failure to disclose material conflicts.\n\nOn October 16, 2024, the Court entered a final judgment by consent against the City and Brooks-Harris.\u00a0 The City, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, consented to the entry of the final judgment, which enjoined it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Brooks-Harris, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to the entry of the final judgment, which enjoined her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Court also entered a conduct-based injunction against Brooks-Harris, enjoining her from participating in any issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of municipal securities, and participating in the preparation of any offering materials with respect to municipal securities among other things.\n\nOn December 26, 2024, the court entered a final judgment by consent against the CMA Defendants.\u00a0 The CMA Defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, consented to the entry of the final judgment which: (a) enjoined them from future violations of Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act and MSRB Rules G-17, G-42, and G-44, and (b) ordered civil penalties of $175,000 as to CMA, $30,000 as to Ganci, and $30,000 as to Tortora.\u00a0 As part of the settlement, the SEC dismissed its claims against CMA and Ganci for violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n\nThe SEC previously settled charges against former District CFO Everton Sewell who, without admitting or denying the allegations, agreed to a final judgment, which was entered on June 21, 2022, (a) enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, (b) enjoining him from participating in any issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of municipal securities, and participating in the preparation of any offering materials with respect to municipal securities among other things, and (c) ordering him to pay a $25,000 penalty.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Eugene Hansen and Daniel Maher under the supervision of James Carlson, and the investigation was conducted by Cori Whitten, Warren Greth, Laura Cunningham, Jonathan Wilcox, and Creighton Papier of the Enforcement Division\u2019s Public Finance Abuse Unit under the supervision of Ivonia Slade and Rebecca Olsen.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

(\"ForceField Energy\"). The SEC alleges that Brown was paid cash kickbacks in exchange for recommending and buying shares of ForceField Energy stock in his customers' accounts without disclosing to customers that he was being paid cash kickbacks.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charged Brown with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. On December 23, 2024, the Court entered a final judgment against Brown by consent in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions and to disgorge $30,000 in ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest thereon, the payment of which was deemed satisfied by the restitution order in the parallel criminal proceeding, United States v.

Dewitz of Inlet Beach, Florida.\u00a0 Dewitz is a former executive of a biopharmaceutical company.\u00a0 The Commission\u2019s action alleges that he traded in the securities of two related public companies based on material nonpublic information from his former employer.\u00a0 Dewitz\u2019s trading occurred ahead of a public announcement that his employer had agreed to merge with one of the two related public companies.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida, alleges that Dewitz thereby violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\u00a0 The Commission\u2019s action seeks a final judgment ordering Dewitz to pay disgorgement of $70,382.96 in unlawful profits, along with $14,809.53 in prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty equal to his unlawful gains.\u00a0 The action also seeks to have Dewitz enjoined from future violations of the charged antifraud provisions and barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.\u00a0 Without admitting or denying the Commission\u2019s allegations, Dewitz has consented to entry of a judgment granting the sought relief.\u00a0 The settlement is subject to approval by the Court.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Christopher Margand and Thomas E.

The complaint alleges that Mihaylov partnered with certain of the other defendants in at least two \u201cpump-and-dump\u201d frauds involving penny stock issuers Steampunk Wizards Inc. and Cantabio Pharmaceuticals Inc., and, separately, perpetrated at least one other fraudulent \u201cpump and dump\u201d involving another issuer, Lifelogger Technologies Corp. According to the complaint, Mihaylov used offshore accounts and front companies to conceal that he was the beneficiary of stock sales and failed both to disclose his beneficial ownership and trading and to register his stock sales as legally required. Prior to engaging in the conduct charged against him in the complaint, Mihaylov, by consent, had been permanently enjoined from such conduct in an earlier Commission penny stock fraud enforcement action against him.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged Mihaylov with violating the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n\nMihaylov consented to the entry of a final judgment that imposes injunctive relief against future violations of all charged provisions, a conduct-based injunction, a penny stock bar, a permanent bar from serving as an officer or director of any public company, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,011,600, prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $304,466, and a civil penalty in the amount of $1,011,600. The judgment against Mihaylov is the first one entered in the SEC v. Bauer et al. case.\n\nThe ongoing case against the remaining defendants is being handled by Benjamin D. Brutlag, Kenneth W. Donnelly, David A. Nasse and J. Lee Buck II.\n\nSee also Lit.

Sai-Hong Ignatius Ou, No. 1:24-cv-13113 (D. Mass. filed Dec. 18, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges Principal Investigator of Pharmaceutical Trial with Insider Trading\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against Sai-Hong Ignatius Ou, a physician and clinical professor at a California public university, for insider trading in advance of an October 28, 2022, public announcement relaying positive news about clinical trials of a cancer fighting drug being developed by Nuvalent, Inc., for which Ou was serving as a principal clinical investigator. Nuvalent is a Massachusetts-based pharmaceutical company.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, on June 16, 2022, Ou\u2014while serving as the principal investigator at his California university for clinical trials of Nuvalent\u2019s cancer fighting drug\u2014learned that Nuvalent would be publicly announcing positive clinical trial results at a conference on October 28, 2022. The SEC\u2019s complaint further alleges that, after learning of Nuvalent\u2019s planned public announcement, Ou purchased 80,000 shares of Nuvalent stock. Following the announcement on October 28, 2022, Nuvalent\u2019s stock price increased by 60%, resulting in the value of the 80,000 Nuvalent shares Ou purchased after June 16 to increase by $1,520,455.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, charges Ou with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the complaint\u2019s allegations, Ou has consented to entry of a final judgment that enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, orders him to pay disgorgement of the $1,520,455 in illicit profits with prejudgment interest, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,520,455, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.

Cal. filed Dec. 10, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Announces Settlement of Fraud and Regulation Best Interest Violations Against Christopher Booth Kennedy, a Former Broker\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against former broker Christopher Booth Kennedy for securities law violations that resulted in millions of dollars of losses for his former brokerage customers.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, between February 2021 and July 2021, Kennedy, who formerly worked as a registered representative at Western International Securities, Inc., made false and misleading statements to his customers regarding the value and success of his trading strategy. The SEC alleges that Kennedy's fraudulent conduct included sending one customer falsified account statements that grossly overstated the value of the customer's account. The complaint further alleges that between July 2020 and July 2021, Kennedy also violated Reg Best Interest by recommending a short-term, high-volume investment strategy in 19 brokerage retail customer accounts without a reasonable basis for doing so. The SEC alleges that Kennedy's recommendations resulted in more than $363 million in total transactions spread through the 19 accounts, ultimately resulting in over $9 million in customer losses.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges Kennedy with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as well as Regulation Best Interest, Rule 15l-1(a) of the Exchange Act.\n\nKennedy has agreed to settle the above charges, by consenting to the entry of an injunction, agreeing to pay $958,134 in disgorgement with $218,267 in prejudgment interest and a $958,134 civil penalty.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by David Rosen and supervised by Marc Blau.

The entry of the consent judgments resolves all claims arising out of the SEC\u2019s March 31, 2022 complaint, which alleged that Rockwell and Dow Rockwell LLC failed to disclose compensation they received in connection with soliciting and recommending investments in the securities of Professional Financial Investors, Inc. (\u201cPFI\u201d), a Marin County, California real estate investment and management company that defrauded investors. As alleged, PFI operated as a Ponzi scheme, where a substantial portion of investor funds was used to pay back previous investors, and more than $35 million in investor funds was misappropriated by PFI\u2019s executives. The complaint also alleged that Rockwell and Dow Rockwell LLC did not disclose the past criminal conviction of PFI\u2019s founder to their clients and that, during the time Rockwell and Dow Rockwell LLC offered and sold PFI securities, neither was registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC or associated with a registered broker-dealer.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Rockwell and Dow Rockwell LLC consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933; and Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Maurizio Chiriva-Internati, No. 4:24-cv-04729 (S.D. Tex., filed Dec. 3, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Former CEO of Biotherapeutics Company with Misleading Investors about Status of FDA Reviews\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against Maurizio Chiriva-Internati, the former CEO of Houston-based biotherapeutics company, Kiromic BioPharma, Inc., for failing to disclose material information about Kiromic\u2019s two cancer fighting drug candidates before, during, and after a July 2, 2021 follow-on public offering that raised $40 million.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Kiromic raised $40 million in a public offering on July 2, 2021 for the purpose of funding the prospective clinical trials for its two cancer fighting drug candidates, the ALEXIS-PRO-1 and the ALEXIS-ISO-1. However, the complaint alleges that two weeks before the public offering, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notified Kiromic that it had placed the drug candidates on clinical hold\u2014an FDA order to delay the proposed clinical investigations. The complaint also alleges that Kiromic did not disclose the FDA clinical holds in its SEC filings, investor roadshow calls, or during due diligence calls leading up to the offering, despite the fact that Kiromic disclosed the hypothetical risk of a clinical hold and the potential negative consequences on Kiromic\u2019s business. The SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that Chiriva learned about the FDA clinical holds for the ALEXIS-PRO-1 and the ALEXIS-ISO-1 on June 16 and 17, 2021, respectively. The complaint alleges that Chiriva reviewed, signed, and contributed content to a report filed with the SEC on June 25, 2021, and signed and certified another report filed with the SEC on August 13, 2021, both of which failed to disclose the FDA clinical holds. The complaint also alleges that three days before Kiromic\u2019s offering, Chiriva participated in roadshow calls with investors and did not correct misstatements by another Kiromic officer about the status of the FDA review by disclosing the FDA\u2019s clinical holds.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, charges Chiriva with violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), and for aiding and abetting Kiromic\u2019s violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-13, and 13a-15(a). Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Chiriva has agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges by consenting to a $125,000 civil penalty, to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud, reporting, certification, and disclosure controls provisions of the federal securities laws, and to be barred for three years from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Kendrack Lewis of the SEC\u2019s Fort Worth Regional Office, under the supervision of Samantha S. Martin and B. David Fraser. The SEC\u2019s litigation will be led by Jennifer Reece and supervised by Keefe Bernstein.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Walczak, a former mutual fund portfolio manager, for fraudulently misrepresenting to investors how he managed risk in the Catalyst Hedged Futures Strategy Fund.\u00a0 The Court ordered Walczak to pay $11.2 million and also restricted Walczak from managing or advising on investments for others.\u00a0 The order follows an April 18, 2022 jury verdict finding against Walczak on the SEC\u2019s negligence-based fraud claims.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint against Walczak alleged that he toldinvestors that the Fund employed a risk management strategy involving safeguards to prevent losses of more than 8%, when in fact no such safeguards limited losses and Walczak did not otherwise consistently manage the Fund to an 8% loss threshold.\u00a0 The complaint further alleged that, between December 2016 and February 2017, the Fund breached certain risk parameters and Walczak failed to take the required corrective action. The fund lost more than $700 million \u2013 approximately 20% of its value \u2013 as markets moved against it, according to the complaint.\u00a0\n\nThe jury found Walczak violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, but also found he did not violate Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 206(1) of the Advisers Act.\u00a0 Based on the jury\u2019s verdict, the Court ordered Walczak to pay $7,765,105 in disgorgement, $1,868,158.50 in prejudgment interest, and a $1,600,000 civil penalty, and enjoined Walczak from managing or advising on investments in securities or commodity futures for any third parties, except for his wife or children, until April 18, 2027.\n\nThe SEC previously announced on January 27, 2020 a related settled action against the Fund\u2019s investment adviser, Catalyst Capital Advisors LLC, and its President and Chief Executive Officer, Jerry Szilagyi.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Michael Foster, along with Jake Schmidt and Kristine Rodriguez of the Chicago Regional Office, David Benson of the Denver Regional Office, and Keefe Bernstein of the Fort Worth Regional Office.\u00a0 The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Timothy Page et al., Civil Action No. 1:21-cv-05292 (E.D.N.Y. filed Sept. 23, 2021)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgment Against Four Defendants in a Transatlantic Microcap Fraud Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on November 14, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a judgment against United Kingdom resident Timothy Page and three entities in an SEC case alleging that they participated in a fraudulent scheme to profit from the manipulation and illegal sale of stock. Among other things, the four defendants were ordered to pay more than $11 million in total disgorgement and prejudgment interest and more than $10 million in total civil penalties.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that Timothy Page and his son, Trevor Page, schemed with associates to acquire millions of shares in U.S. publicly traded microcap companies, disguise their control over the companies, and then sell their shares into the public markets in violation of the securities laws. The Pages allegedly used nominee entities, including defendants Wellesley Holdings Limited, Porrima Limited, Emergent Investment Company, FJ Investments International Inc., and Ticino Capital Limited, to conceal their holdings in the microcap companies. According to the complaint, the Pages then engaged in manipulative trading and hired boiler rooms to generate artificial demand for their stock by making misleading statements to investors. The complaint also alleges that Timothy Page's wife, Janan Page, received proceeds from the Pages' fraudulent scheme.\n\nThe judgment, entered by default, enjoins Timothy Page, Wellesley, Porrima, and Emergent from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and enjoins Timothy Page from violating Sections 9(a) and 13(d) of the Exchange Act. The judgment also prohibits Timothy Page from participating in the offer or sale of securities, except for securities listed on a national securities exchange for his personal account. The judgment orders Timothy Page to pay disgorgement of $7,652,228, prejudgment interest of $983,819, and a civil penalty of $7,652,228. It orders Wellesley to pay disgorgement of $1,928,907, prejudgment interest of $133,853, and a civil penalty of $1,928,907; Porrima to pay disgorgement of $753,239, prejudgment interest of $52,270, and a civil penalty of $753,239; and Emergent to pay disgorgement of $456,963, prejudgment interest of $34,298, and a civil penalty of $456,963. Wellesley, Porrima, and Emergent were held jointly and severally liable for certain amounts of Timothy Page's disgorgement and prejudgment interest. Relief defendant Janan Page was ordered to pay $1,085,000 in disgorgement and $181,296 in prejudgment interest.\n\nFJ Investments previously consented to a final judgment, entered on April 29, 2022, that enjoined it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13d-1 thereunder. FJ Investments also consented to pay $1,046 in disgorgement and to surrender shares it held in one of the microcap companies at issue. On June 28, 2023, the SEC dismissed its complaint without prejudice as to the entity defendant Ticino Capital Limited.\n\nThe SEC's litigation, which is ongoing against defendant Trevor Page, is being conducted by Kathleen Shields and Alexandra Lavin of the SEC's Boston Regional Office.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Robert Brian Thompson, No. 3:24-cv-00800-MHL (E.D. Va., filed Nov. 8, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Richmond Federal Reserve Banking Supervisor with Insider Trading\n\n\n\nOn November 8, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed insider trading charges against Robert Brian Thompson, a long-time banking supervisor and examiner at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, for allegedly using material nonpublic information to trade in stock and options of two publicly traded banks that were under his supervisory purview.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, in October 2023, Thompson, of Moseley, Virginia, obtained a preview of an upcoming positive earnings announcement by one of the banks in his supervisory portfolio. Based on that information, Thompson allegedly bought $678,000 worth of the bank's stock hours before the scheduled announcement, which resulted in $79,346 of ill-gotten profits. The SEC's complaint further alleges that, in January 2024, Thompson learned that a different bank in his supervisory portfolio would be disclosing unexpected loan losses worth hundreds of millions of dollars as part of an upcoming earnings announcement. Thompson allegedly leveraged that material nonpublic information to buy thousands of options on the bank's stock two days before the scheduled announcement, which led to $505,527 of ill-gotten profits.\n\nThe SEC's investigation originated from the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, which used Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) data to analyze Thompson's suspicious trading activity.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, charges Thompson with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks a final judgment ordering Thompson to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil penalties, and enjoining him from committing future violations of the charged antifraud provisions. Thompson has consented to the entry of an injunction, with disgorgement and civil penalties, if any, to be determined later by the Court. The settlement is subject to Court approval.\n\nEarlier today, Thompson pleaded guilty to criminal charges in a parallel action brought by the U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Derek M. Schoenmann, David Bennett, John S. Rymas, and Lindsay S. Moilanen of the SEC's Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit and supervised by Market Abuse Unit Chief Joseph G. Sansone. The SEC's litigation is being led by Mr. Schoenmann and Timothy K. Halloran and supervised by Preethi Krishnamurthy. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, and the Federal Reserve Board's Office of the Inspector General.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Ian Mitchell, No. 24-civ-8741 (S.D.N.Y. filed November 18, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges NY Man Claiming to be a Billionaire with Offering Fraud\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced it charged Ian Mitchell, a resident of Queens, New York, with defrauding investors in an offering fraud scheme. Mitchell agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges.\n\nIn a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC alleges that between July 2021 and February 2022, Mitchell solicited investors by misrepresenting his identity, family background and wealth, ability to access private placement stock, and what he intended to do with the investors\u2019 funds. In particular, the SEC alleges that Mitchell used a fictitious name and falsely claimed to be the nephew of an African billionaire, and told the investors that he planned to use their money to purchase pre-IPO stock of two privately owned companies. The SEC also alleges that two investors gave Mitchell approximately $325,000 to purchase stock based on Mitchell\u2019s misrepresentations. According to the complaint, Mitchell did not use any of the investors\u2019 funds to purchase the stock, and instead, he used the funds to pay his personal expenses.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Mitchell with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Mitchell consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating those provisions of the federal securities laws and an officer and director bar. The judgment also orders Mitchell liable for $325,000 disgorgement and $53,072.65 in prejudgment interest, which are deemed satisfied by the restitution and forfeiture orders entered in a parallel criminal action. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nPreviously, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York filed a criminal action against Mitchell, who pled guilty to one count of wire fraud. On July 11, 2024, he was sentenced to a prison term of 44 months followed by 3 years supervised release and ordered to make $469,999 in restitution and $469,999 in forfeiture.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Sheldon Mui, Travis Hill, Neil Hendelman, and Gerald A. Gross, and supervised by Sheldon L. Pollock, all of the New York Regional Office.

Brown allegedly made the purchases without informing his customers that he was receiving kickbacks in connection with the purchases.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Brown consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, permanently barring him from participating in an offering of penny stock, and ordering disgorgement of $10,000 in ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest thereon.\n\nThe litigation was led by Mary Kay Dunning and Lindsay S.

Money Magnet Platinum Membership Initiative LLC, et al., No. 22-cv-7640 (S.D.N.Y Nov. 7, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgements Against Lakenya Hopkins\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced that is has obtained final judgement against Lakenya Hopkins for her role in a promissory note selling scheme, falsely promising investors extraordinary returns.\n\nOn November 7, 2024, the Honorable Jed S. Rakoff, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York, issued an Order approving the SEC\u2019s settlement with Lakenya Hopkins and entered Final Judgement. The SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that, between late 2020 and early 2021, Hopkins and her company, Money Magnet Platinum Membership Initiative (MMPMI), solicited more than one hundred prospective investors to invest in MMPMI through promissory notes they called \u201cmagnets.\u201d As alleged in the Complaint, MMPMI and Hopkins, without a reasonable basis, promised investors guaranteed and extraordinary monthly returns for each magnet they purchased. Additionally, the Complaint alleges, Hopkins misappropriated investor funds for her own benefit.\n\nIn September 2022, the SEC charged MMPMI and Hopkins with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Final Judgment includes permanent injunctions against future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities law and requires Hopkins to pay full disgorgement of $262,280, plus prejudgment interest of $20,056, which has been deemed satisfied by the order of restitution of $289,630 entered against her in a parallel criminal matter.\n\nIn 2023, the Court entered judgments as to Hopkins and MMPMI, granting the SEC injunctive relief and leaving open the issue of monetary relief. The Final Judgment for Hopkins reaffirms the injunctive relief against her while resolving the issue of monetary relief. The SEC is foregoing seeking monetary relief against MMPMI.\n\nIn the parallel action brought by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, Hopkins was convicted on one count of securities fraud based on the same facts alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, ordered to pay restitution, and is serving a two-year prison sentence.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Victor Suthammanont and Stewart Gilson, and was supervised by Gerald Gross, Alexander Vasilescu, and Tejal Shah.

Pannon Investment Advisors LLC and Dusan Varga, No. 1:24-cv-24241 (S.D. Fla. filed Oct. 30, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Florida Resident with Operating a $1.6 Million Ponzi Scheme Targeting the Serbian-American Community\n\n\n\nYesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) charged Pannon Investment Advisors LLC and its Chief Executive Officer, Dusan Varga, alleging they fraudulently raised approximately $1.6 million from at least 20 investors through an unregistered securities offering. Most of the investors are members of the Serbian-American community, and this case is part of the Miami Regional Office\u2019s Fraud Against Minority Groups Initiative.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that from May 2020 through approximately January 2024, Varga and Pannon raised at least $1.6 million from at least 20 investors to invest in the Pannon Risk-Managed Income Fund (\u201cPannon Fund\u201d), by making repeated material misrepresentations and selling unregistered securities. As alleged, the misrepresentations concerned, among other things, Varga\u2019s and Pannon\u2019s use of investor funds, the profitability of the Pannon Fund\u2019s trading activities, Varga\u2019s background as a purported registered representative of a broker-dealer, and the risks of investing in the Pannon Fund. The complaint further alleges Varga and Pannon made Ponzi-like payments to investors, misused and misappropriated investor funds, and otherwise engaged in a variety of conduct which operated as a fraud and deceit on investors.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges Varga and Pannon with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d). Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Varga and Pannon consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, which would permanently enjoin each of them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder of the Advisers Act. The final judgment, if approved by the court, also would impose an officer and director bar against Varga, and order Varga and Pannon to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the SEC.\n\nMelika Hadziomerovic and Lina M. Fernandez in the Miami Regional Office conducted the SEC\u2019s investigation under the supervision of Eric R. Busto and Glenn S. Gordon. The SEC\u2019s litigation will be led by Christine Nestor.

Donna Dellomo, Yoon Um, and The Lovesac Company, No. 3:24-civ-01727 (D. Conn. filed October 29, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Furniture Company and Two Former Executives with Accounting Violations\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed charges against Connecticut-based publicly traded furniture retailer The Lovesac Company, Donna Dellomo, CPA, Lovesac\u2019s former CFO, and Yoon Um, CPA, Lovesac\u2019s former controller, for accounting violations in connection with expenses Lovesac incurred shipping its furniture to customers.\u00a0 Lovesac has agreed to a settlement to resolve the claims against it by, among other things, paying a civil penalty of $1.5 million.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleges that Lovesac failed to properly record the cost of shipping finished products from Lovesac\u2019s distribution center to its end customers.\u00a0 According to the complaint, in April 2023, Lovesac\u2019s finance team found that invoices for products shipped during fiscal year 2023 were not recorded in Lovesac\u2019s books and records until the first quarter of fiscal year 2024.\u00a0 The invoices totaled approximately $2.2 million and would have significantly impacted certain of the company\u2019s financial metrics for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024.\u00a0 The complaint alleges that, to avoid impacting the company\u2019s financial metrics and to avoid a costly restatement of the company\u2019s fiscal year 2023 SEC filings, Dellomo and Um fraudulently concealed the $2.2 million shipping expenses. \u00a0According to the complaint, Dellomo furthered the fraud by withholding information from Lovesac\u2019s outside audit firm and then signing a document filed with the SEC she knew was false and misleading.\u00a0 Moreover, the complaint alleges that Lovesac and Dellomo failed to implement sufficient internal controls that may have prevented the fraudulent accounting.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charges Dellomo with violating Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d); Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder; and aiding and abetting\u00a0violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 thereunder.\u00a0 The SEC\u2019s complaint charges Um with violating Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act; Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a), 10b-5(c), and 13b2-1 thereunder; and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.\u00a0 In its case against Dellomo and Um, the SEC seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, conduct-based injunctions, and officer-and-director bars.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint also charges Lovesac with violating Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act; Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.\u00a0 Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Lovesac has agreed to the entry of a final judgment ordering it to pay a $1.5 million penalty and imposing a permanent injunction against future violations to settle the charges.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case is being handled by Xinyue Angela Lin, Samantha McGregor, Patrick Noone, Alfred Day, Martin Healey, and Paul Block of the Boston Regional Office.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Cal. filed Oct. 22, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Settles Action Against Beverly Hills Resident For Involvement In Scheme to Defraud Readers of Citron Research Tweets\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Ryan Choi agreed to pay more than $1.8 million to settle charges that he negligently engaged in a scheme to defraud readers of Citron Research in connection with two tweets issued by the platform. In July 2024, the SEC charged Andrew Left, who operates the Citron Research website and related social media platforms, for engaging in a scheme to defraud Citron Research followers by publishing false and misleading statements regarding his supposed stock trading recommendations.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint against Choi alleges that in December 2020, Choi worked with Left on the research and content for two buy recommendations that Left issued through Citron Research. According to the complaint, Choi failed to act reasonably by not conducting adequate research or due diligence, which he provided to Left to support the recommendations that Left included in the Citron Research tweets. The complaint further alleges that Choi quickly traded on price increases that came after the two Citron Research tweets, and negligently failed to ensure that this trading activity was adequately disclosed in the tweets. According to the complaint, Choi made a total of $1,647,217 in profits in connection with his trading around these two tweets.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charges Choi with violating Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Choi agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and requiring him to pay a civil penalty of $115,231, disgorgement of $1,647,217, and prejudgment interest of $64,818.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Wendy E. Pearson and Sarah S. Nilson and supervised by Finola H. Manvelian. Trial attorney Stephen Kam, Carina Chambarry and Michael Barnes in the SEC\u2019s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and Darren Boerner in the Division of Enforcement\u2019s Market Abuse Unit provided assistance.

(\u201cEnvironmental Packaging\u201d). \u00a0Among other things, they were each ordered to pay $230,464 in civil penalties.\u00a0 The court previously entered judgments against four other defendants, including a judgment against Swiss resident Daniel Lacher in 2022 that, among other things, ordered him to pay a total of over $479,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint was filed in 2018 against four defendants, including Lacher, and was later amended in 2019 to add Quinn and Skriloff as defendants.\u00a0 The complaint alleged that Quinn facilitated the reverse merger between a \u201cpublic shell company\u201d secretly controlled by co-defendant Morrie Tobin and a privately held operating company of which Skriloff was the Chief Executive Officer. \u00a0The complaint further alleged that after the reverse merger, Quinn arranged and oversaw a $1 million promotional campaign designed to increase demand for Environmental Packaging\u2019s publicly traded stock and directed certain offshore asset managers to sell stock held by Tobin for a profit. \u00a0According to the complaint, Skriloff became the CEO of Environmental Packaging and made misstatements in public reports filed with the SEC about the reverse merger and the company\u2019s connection to the promotional campaign.\u00a0 The complaint alleged that Lacher, an offshore asset manager, facilitated various schemes, including the Environmental Packaging scheme, by utilizing a network of nominee entities to secretly hold control persons\u2019 shares, arranging for the deposit of those shares with brokers, selling those shares to investors, and sharing in the profits.\u00a0 The SEC halted trading in the securities of Environmental Packaging on June 27, 2017.\u00a0 According to the complaint, Quinn, Skriloff, and Lacher participated in efforts to cover up the fraud and obstruct the investigation after the trading halt. \u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged Quinn, Skriloff, and Lacher with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. \u00a0It also charged Quinn with violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act. \u00a0The complaint charged Skriloff with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, aiding and abetting the other defendants\u2019 violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act, and aiding and abetting Environmental Packaging\u2019s violation of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Quinn consented to the entry of a final judgment that includes injunctive relief for all charged provisions and the penny stock bar that were previously ordered by the court in a July 2022 judgment and orders him to pay a $230,464 civil penalty.\u00a0 Without admitting or denying the allegations, Skriloff consented to the entry of a final judgment that includes injunctive relief for all charged provisions and the penny stock and officer and director bars that were previously ordered by the court in an August 2024 judgment and orders him to pay a $230,464 civil penalty.\u00a0 The court previously entered a final judgment by default against Lacher on April 22, 2022 that included injunctive relief for all charged provisions, a penny stock bar, and an order to pay disgorgement of $53,658.73, pre-judgment interest of $11,641.93, and a civil penalty of $414,366.\n\nThe court previously entered judgments in 2021 against defendants Tobin, Matthew Ledvina, and Milan Patel, and, with the entry of the judgments against Quinn and Skriloff, the SEC\u2019s case is now concluded.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by David Scheffler, Kathleen Shields, J.

Russell Armand, Maxwell Hernandez, Manpreet Singh Kohli, and Nam Tran, No. 1:24-cv-12586-AK (D. Mass. filed Oct. 9, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Four Promoters in Crackdown on Manipulation of Crypto Assets Offered and Sold as Securities\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced fraud charges against four individuals for engaging in schemes to manipulate the markets for two crypto assets, \u201cSaitama Inu\u201d and \u201cSaitaRealty,\u201d being offered and sold as securities to retail investors. As alleged, the schemes were intended to induce investor victims to purchase the crypto assets by creating the false appearance of an active trading market for them.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, crypto asset promoters Russell Armand, a resident of Texas, Maxwell Hernandez, a resident of Massachusetts, Manpreet Singh Kohli, a resident of India and England, and Nam Tran, an apparent resident of Washington, through the \u201cSaitama\u201d website, whitepaper, and social media statements, allegedly made public misrepresentations about their team\u2019s development of a \u201cSaitama ecosystem\u201d of multiple products (including smart wallet applications and trading platforms) to artificially increase the value of the Saitama Inu crypto asset. The defendants also made allegedly false statements about buying or holding Saitama Inu while surreptitiously selling substantial amounts of the crypto asset. The defendants also allegedly engaged in market manipulation themselves and hired so-called market makers ZM Quant Investment Ltd. and Gotbit Consulting LLC to provide market-manipulation-as-a-service, which included generating artificial trading volume or manipulating the price of the Saitama Inu and SaitaRealty crypto assets that were offered and sold as securities to retail investors in unregistered transactions.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleges that all defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus pre-judgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars against all the defendants. Armand and Hernandez consented to bifurcated settlements, subject to court approval, permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, subjecting them to conduct-based injunctions, and barring them from acting as officers or directors. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest and any civil penalties.\n\nThe SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts, which has announced parallel criminal actions.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by David D\u2019Addio, Amy Harman Burkart, Ivan Panchenko, Jeffrey Cook, and John McCann in the SEC\u2019s Boston Regional Office, as well as Colin Missett and Joy Guo of the Crypto Asset and Cyber Unit (CACU).

The Pre IPO Marketplace Inc; Keyport Venture Partners, LLC; Keyport Venture Management, LLC; Keyport Venture Advisors, LLC; Principal Pre-IPO Consulting Group LLC; GlobalX VC LLC; John Michael LoPinto; Robert Wilkos; and Laren Pisciotti, No. 1:24-civ-06886 (E.D.N.Y. filed Sept. 30, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Three Individuals in the New York Metropolitan Area for Perpetrating a $120 Million Pre-IPO Fraud Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged John LoPinto, Robert Wilkos, and Laren Pisciotti for their roles in a fraudulent scheme involving investments in pre-IPO private companies. The SEC also charged several companies owned and/or controlled by the defendants: the Pre IPO Marketplace Inc. (\"Marketplace\"); Keyport Venture Partners LLC (\"Keyport Partners\"); Keyport Venture Management LLC (\"Keyport Management\"); and Keyport Venture Advisors LLC (\"Keyport Advisors\"), which were jointly owned and/or controlled by LoPinto and Wilkos; and Principal Pre-IPO Consulting Group LLC (\"Principal\") and GlobalX VC LLC (\"GlobalX\"), which were owned or controlled by Pisciotti.\n\nThe SEC complaint alleges that from at least October 2019 until December 2022, the defendants raised approximately $120 million from more than 900 investors in the U.S. and abroad by selling interests in private funds that supposedly held shares in pre-IPO companies, that is, privately held companies that had not yet conducted an initial public offering. The SEC alleges that the defendants, directly and through sales agents, told investors numerous lies about the supposed investments, including that there were no upfront fees in the investments while in fact paying themselves at least $16 million in commissions; that the funds were registered with the SEC when they were not; and that the funds owned shares in pre-IPO companies when they did not. In addition, according to the complaint, LoPinto used an alias to conduct business to hide his disciplinary history, which includes prior sanctions by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA. The complaint also alleges that many investors never received the pre-IPO shares that they were promised and for which they invested with the defendants.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. It also charges Marketplace, Keyport Partners, Keyport Management, Keyport Advisors, GlobalX, LoPinto, Wilkos, and Pisciotti with violating Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder; and Marketplace, Principal, LoPinto, Wilkos, and Pisciotti with violating Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties from all defendants. The complaint also seeks industry and officer-and-director bars against LoPinto, Wilkos, and Pisciotti. Wilkos has agreed to settle the case and consent to injunctive relief, with the court determining additional remedies at a later date.\n\nThe SEC's ongoing investigation is being conducted by Randall D. Friedland, Elizabeth Doisy, Eleanor J.G. Wasserman, and Jeffrey Anderson and is supervised by Pei Y. Chung, Peter Rosario, and Stacy L. Bogert.

Rari Capital, Inc., Jai Bhavnani, Jack Lipstone, and David Lucid, Case No. 2:24-cv-07967-PA-MAA (C.D. Cal. filed Sept. 18, 2024)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgments Against Rari Capital, Inc. and its Founders in Connection with Their Operation of Crypto Investment Platforms\n\nOn September19, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered final judgments against Rari Capital, Inc. and its three co-founders\u2014Jai Bhavnani, Jack Lipstone, and David Lucid\u2014for various violations of the securities offering registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the broker registration provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Court ordered injunctive relief, equitable officer-and-director bars against the co-founders for a period of five years, and total monetary remedies of $63,567.51 against Bhavnani, $43,199.98 against Lipstone, and $45,208.92 against Lucid.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Rari Capital offered two investment products, Earn pools and Fuse pools, which functioned like crypto asset investment funds, allowing investors to deposit crypto assets in lending pools, either managed by Rari (Earn) or user-created (Fuse), and earn returns from their investments. The SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that investors in the pools received a token representing their interest in the pools and the right to receive profits earned by the pools. Certain Earn pool investors also received a governance token, called the Rari Governance Token, or RGT. By selling interests in these pools and RGT, the complaint alleged, Rari Capital conducted unregistered offers and sales of securities.\n\nFurthermore, the SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that Rari Capital and its co-founders falsely told investors that the Earn pools would automatically and autonomously rebalance their crypto assets into the highest yield-generating opportunities available when, in reality, the rebalancing mechanism often required manual input, which Rari Capital sometimes failed to initiate. The SEC also alleged that Rari Capital and its co-founders misleadingly touted the high annual percentage yield that investors would earn, but they failed to account for various fees and, ultimately, a significant percentage of Earn pool investors lost money on their investments.\n\nFurthermore, the SEC alleged that Rari Capital and its co-founders engaged in unregistered broker activity through their operation of the Fuse platform.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Bhavnani and Lipstone each consented to the entry of a final judgment that: (1) permanently enjoined him from future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; (2) enjoined him for a period of five years from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of crypto assets offered and sold as securities, except for his own personal accounts; (3) equitably barred him for a period of five years from serving as an officer or director of a public company; (4) ordered the payment of disgorgement plus prejudgment interest; and (5) ordered the payment of a civil monetary penalty. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Lucid consented to the entry of a nearly identical final judgment, with the exception that it did not include an injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Finally, without admitting or denying the allegations, Rari Capital consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoined it from: (1) future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a)(2), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and (2) participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Madiha M. Zuberi and Erin E. Wilk of the Division of Enforcement\u2019s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and was supervised by Jason H. Lee and David Zhou of the San Francisco Regional Office.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            Final Judgment - Jai Bhavnani\n  \n\n              \n            Final Judgment - Rari Capital, Inc.\n  \n\n              \n            Final Judgment - Jack Lipstone \n  \n\n              \n            Final Judgment - David Lucid\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

The SEC alleged while in that role, Siegel shorted Foot Locker stock in advance of the company\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings announcement in May 2023. The SEC further alleged, after the announcement, Foot Locker\u2019s stock price fell by 27.24%, and Siegel covered his short position for a $82,736.06 profit. The complaint further alleged, in early August 2023, about a week after being laid off from his job at Foot Locker, Siegel sold short Foot Locker stock again, this time in advance of the company\u2019s announcement of its second quarter 2023 earnings. According to the complaint, after that announcement, the stock price fell by 28.28% and Siegel covered his short position for a $30,132.89 profit. The SEC further alleges that before each of his trades, Siegel was in possession of material nonpublic information concerning Foot Locker\u2019s operating results, including negative sales and inventory figures, and he traded based on that information despite being subject to Foot Locker\u2019s Policy Prohibiting Insider Trading.\n\nThe final judgment signed by the Honorable Ronnie Abrams permanently enjoins Siegel from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; orders him to pay disgorgement of $112,868.95 plus prejudgment interest of $9,975.97; imposes a civil monetary penalty of $112,868.95; and bars him from acting or serving as an officer or director of a public company.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Jeremy Brandt, Wes Wintermyer, Matthew Lambert, and Lauren Sheridan of the SEC\u2019s New York Regional Office, and was supervised by Celeste Chase and Sheldon L. Pollock.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Seong Yeol Lee and Ameritrust Corporation, et al., No. 3:23-cv-00125 (D. Conn., filed Feb. 1, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgments in Microcap Fraud Case\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on September 27, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut entered judgment against the estate of defendant Seong Yeol Lee in a microcap fraud case filed by the SEC in 2023. The judgment orders disgorgement of $3,255,668 and prejudgment interest of $589,000. Those amounts are deemed satisfied by the transfer of Lee\u2019s frozen funds to the Commission and proceeds from the sale of property in New York that the Commission alleges Lee improperly purchased with misappropriated investor money. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Lee\u2019s estate consented to the entry of the judgment.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s action alleged that Ameritrust and its CEO, Lee, misled and stole funds from investors in the United States and the Republic of Korea between at least 2019 and 2023. The SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that, through a network of recruiters acting at his direction, Lee solicited more than $20 million from investors primarily in the Republic of Korea, who sent money to corporate and personal bank accounts that Lee controlled in the United States to buy shares of Ameritrust, a publicly traded company in the United States. Lee, either directly or through his recruiters, allegedly told investors that their money would be used to buy shares in a U.S.-based company that would be listed on a national stock exchange, guaranteeing profits for anyone holding the shares. In reality, the SEC\u2019s complaint alleged, Ameritrust had no real operations and did not apply for any exchange listing. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Lee misappropriated investor funds by transferring money from corporate bank accounts to his personal bank accounts and to his family members. Lee also allegedly received or held investor funds in accounts of Beespoke Capital, an entity affiliated with Lee and Ameritrust.\n\nThe court also entered judgments requiring the payment of disgorgement by three of Lee\u2019s adult children whom the SEC named as relief defendants in the complaint. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, each of the relief defendants consented to the entry of judgment.\n\nThe court previously entered default judgments against defendant Ameritrust and relief defendant Beespoke Capital. The judgment against Ameritrust prohibits it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10(b)-5 thereunder, and ordered it to pay disgorgement of $11,967,705, plus prejudgment interest of $1,602,391, and a civil penalty of $2,232,280. The judgment against Beespoke Capital ordered it to pay disgorgement of $4,871,097, plus prejudgment interest of $325,421.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

James R. Craigie, No. 1:24-cv-07382 (SDNY filed Sept. 30, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Independent Director and Ex-CEO of Church & Dwight With Concealing Close Friendship with Company Executive\n\n\n\nDefendant spent more than $100,000 on executive\u2019s travel expenses \n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against James R. Craigie, a former CEO, Chairman, and board member of Church & Dwight Co. Inc., for violating proxy disclosure rules by standing for election as an independent director without informing the board of his close personal friendship with a high-ranking Church & Dwight executive thereby causing Church & Dwight\u2019s proxy statements to contain materially misleading statements. Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Craigie agreed to resolve the SEC\u2019s charges. If the settlement is approved, Craigie will be subject to a five-year officer-and-director bar.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, between January 2020 and March 2023, Craigie maintained a close personal relationship with a member of Church & Dwight\u2019s executive team. Among other things, Craigie frequently vacationed with the executive and the executive\u2019s spouse, including six trips that spanned eight countries on five continents. Craigie paid more than $100,000 for them to join Craigie and his spouse on several of these international vacations. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Craigie never disclosed his relationship with the executive to Church & Dwight and he allegedly encouraged the executive to conceal the relationship as well. As a result, the company\u2019s board was unaware of Craigie\u2019s personal relationship with the executive, and the company\u2019s proxy statements subsequently identified Craigie as an independent director. Craigie ultimately served as an independent board member from 2019 to 2023. When Church & Dwight began a CEO succession process, Craigie allegedly shared confidential details about the process with the executive and took steps to better position the executive for succession in the future. Once Church & Dwight learned of Craigie\u2019s relationship with the executive, it determined that he was not an independent director.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Craigie agreed to be permanently enjoined from further violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 thereunder, pay a civil penalty of $175,000, and a five-year officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Elliot Weingarten and James Valentino, assisted by Tonya Tullis and David Nasse, and supervised by Sarah Lamoree, Jeffrey Weiss, and Mark Cave.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Olayinka Temitope Oyebola and Olayinka Oyebola & Co. (Chartered Accountants), No. 24-civ-7363 (S.D.N.Y. filed Sept. 30, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges Olayinka Oyebola and His Accounting Firm With Aiding and Abetting Massive Fraud\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Olayinka Oyebola and his Public Company Accounting Oversight Board-registered accounting firm, Olayinka Oyebola & Co. (Chartered Accountants), with aiding and abetting a massive securities fraud perpetrated by Mmobuosi Odogwu Banye, also known as Dozy Mmobuosi, and three related U.S. companies that Mmobuosi controlled (the Tingo entities). The SEC recently obtained a $250 million final judgment against Mmobuosi and the Tingo entities.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that Oyebola and his firm deliberately failed to take action upon learning that businessman Mmobuosi and the Tingo entities created multiple fake audit reports bearing Oyebola\u2019s signature and included them in SEC filings as though they were issued by Oyebola\u2019s firm. Oyebola allegedly made material misstatements to the then-auditor of one of the Tingo entities, and Oyebola and the firm helped Mmobuosi conceal that the audit reports were fake, resulting in the auditor, investors, and regulators relying upon the misstatements and fake audit reports to their detriment. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Oyebola and his firm\u2019s assistance enabled Mmobuosi and the Tingo entities to carry out a multi-year scheme to inflate financial performance metrics and defraud investors worldwide.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Oyebola and his firm with aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder, by Mmobuosi and the three Tingo entities.

Choice Advisors, LLC and Matthias O\u2019Meara, No. 3:21-cv-01669-JO-MSB (S.D. Cal. filed Sept. 24, 2021)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Municipal Advisor and its Co-Founder\n\n\n\nOn September 24, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California\u00a0entered a final judgment against municipal advisor Choice Advisors, LLC and one of its principals, Matthias O'Meara. The Court ordered permanent injunctive relief as well as total monetary remedies of $187,337 against Choice and $312,572 against O'Meara. The final judgment follows the Court's April 15, 2024 grant of partial summary judgment to the SEC, ruling that Choice and O'Meara had violated their fiduciary obligations and engaged in unregistered municipal advisory activities, among other violations.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleged that Choice and O'Meara entered into an impermissible fee-splitting arrangement with an underwriter to bond offerings in which their municipal advisory clients were borrowers. The SEC further alleged that O'Meara improperly worked on different sides of the same transaction, simultaneously serving as both a municipal advisor as well as a registered representative to the underwriter. According to the SEC, Choice's and O'Meara's municipal advisory activities were unlawful because they were not registered with the SEC or the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). Moreover, the complaint alleged that the defendants breach their fiduciary obligations by failing to disclose the conflicts of interest created by their unregistered status and by O'Meara's dual role.\n\nThe Court previously denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the SEC's complaint on September 13, 2022. On April 15, 2024, the Court granted the SEC partial summary judgment against the defendants, finding that both defendants breached their fiduciary obligations in violation of Section 15B(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and MSRB Rule G-42, and that they failed to deal fairly with their clients in violation of MSRB Rule G-17. Moreover, the Court held that the defendants' fee-splitting arrangement with the underwriting firm violated MSRB Rule G-42. The Court also ruled that Choice failed to register with the SEC and the MSRB in violation of Section 15B(a)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act and MSRB Rule A-12, and that both defendants violated Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act by engaging in municipal advisory activities in contravention of MSRB rules.\n\nIn its final judgment, the Court (i) ordered O'Meara to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $179,081 and a civil penalty of $133,491; (ii) ordered Choice to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $107,448 and a civil penalty of $79,889; and (iii) permanently enjoined both defendants from future violations of the securities laws and MSRB rules identified above.\n\nThe SEC's case was handled by William Salzmann, Sheila O'Callaghan and Andrew Hefty, and supervised by Marc Katz of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office. The investigation was conducted by Mr. Salzmann and Joseph Chimienti of the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Judgment\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Order\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Robert B. Westbrook, No. 2:24-cv-9497 (D.N.J. filed September 27, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges U.K. Citizen in Hacking and Trading Scheme Involving Five U.S. Companies\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against U.K. citizen Robert B. Westbrook for hacking into the computer systems of five U.S. public companies to obtain material nonpublic information about their corporate earnings and using that information to make approximately $3.75 million in illicit profits by trading in advance of the companies' public earnings announcements.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed on September 27, 2024 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleges that, between approximately January 2019 and August 2020, Westbrook gained unauthorized access into the public companies' computer systems-prior to the companies' earnings announcements-by resetting passwords of senior level executives' accounts. As a result of these hacks, Westbrook deceptively obtained material nonpublic information that he used to trade in the securities of the five public companies prior to the release of at least 14 earnings announcements.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Westbrook with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks a final judgment ordering Westbrook to pay civil penalties, ordering him to return his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and enjoining him from committing future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.\n\nIn a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey today filed criminal charges against Westbrook.\n\nThe SEC's investigation, which is ongoing, is being conducted by Alison R. Levine, Karolina Klyuchnikova, and Matthew Lambert of the New York Regional Office; David Austin, Patrick McCluskey, and Matthew Koop of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit; IT Forensics staff member Kenneth Zavos; and Thomas Bedkowski of the SEC Enforcement's Division's Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. The Division of Economic and Risk Analysis also provided substantial assistance. The case is being supervised by Mark R.

Mango Labs, LLC, Mango DAO, and Blockworks Foundation, No. 24-civ-07334 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Entities Operating Crypto Asset Trading Platform Mango Markets for Unregistered Offers and Sales of the Platform\u2019s \u201cMNGO\u201d Governance Tokens\n\n\n\nPair of affiliated entities separately charged for acting as unregistered brokers\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filed settled charges against Mango DAO and Blockworks Foundation for engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of crypto assets called \"MNGO\" tokens. The SEC also settled charges against Blockworks Foundation and Mango Labs LLC for engaging in unregistered broker activity in connection with various crypto assets being offered and sold as securities on the Mango Markets platform. The SEC's complaint alleges that by skirting the SEC's registration provisions, Mango DAO, Blockworks Foundation, and Mango Labs deprived investors of critical protections afforded by the federal securities laws.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, starting in August 2021, Mango DAO, a purportedly decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, and Blockworks Foundation, a Panamanian entity, raised more than $70 million from unregistered offers and sales of MNGO tokens, the so-called governance tokens of the Mango Markets platform, to hundreds of investors worldwide, including in the U.S. The SEC also alleges that, since at least August 2021, Blockworks Foundation and Mango Labs each operated as an unregistered broker by actively soliciting and recruiting users of Mango Markets to trade securities; providing advice and valuations as to the merits of an investment in securities; and helping to facilitate securities transactions on the Mango Markets platform by assisting customers in opening accounts and regularly handling customer funds and securities.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Mango DAO and Blockworks Foundation with violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and charges Blockworks Foundation and Mango Labs with violations of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Mango DAO, Blockworks Foundation, and Mango Labs have agreed to settle the SEC charges, consenting to injunctions and orders to collectively pay nearly $700,000 in civil penalties. They have also agreed to destroy their MNGO tokens, to request the removal of MNGO tokens from trading platforms, and to refrain from soliciting any trading platform to allow trading in or offering or selling MNGO. The settlements are subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Kristin Pauley, with assistance from Thomas Bedkowski, both of the SEC's Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. The SEC's litigation will be led by Alyssa Qualls of the Chicago Regional Office. The matter was supervised by Mr. Tenreiro and Amy Flaherty Hartman, also of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Lionel Selwood, Jr., No. 2:24-cv-08336 (C.D. Cal. filed September 27, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Former CEO of Romeo Power, Inc. for Misleading Investors\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced settled fraud charges against Lionel Selwood, Jr., the former CEO of Romeo Power, Inc., a Southern California-based company that built batteries for commercial electric vehicles. The SEC's complaint alleges that Selwood misled investors about a shortage of battery cells, the main component for the company's products.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, Romeo announced a merger with RMG Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, in October\u00a02020. The complaint alleges that an SEC filing related to the merger disclosed that a cell shortage or inability of suppliers to deliver sufficient cells could have a material adverse effect on the company's business prospects and financial condition. The complaint further alleges that before the merger closed, Selwood - who was responsible for the above risk disclosure made in the filing - knew or should have known a shortage had in fact developed and that Romeo's suppliers were not able to deliver enough cells for the company to meet its previously disclosed revenue projections.\n\nThe SEC's complaint additionally alleges that cell supplier issues became worse following the merger's close on December 29,\u00a02020. According to the complaint, Selwood knew or should have known of the deteriorating cell supply and supplier issues, but in January\u00a02021 signed an SEC filing that continued to provide the same materially false and misleading risk disclosure. As alleged by the complaint, on March 30, 2021, after Romeo announced that it was revising its\u00a02021 revenue projection because of a shortfall in cell capacity industrywide, Romeo's stock price dropped approximately 19.7% on heavy trading volume.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges Selwood with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections\u00a017(a)(2) and\u00a0(a)(3) of the Securities Act of\u00a01933 and Section\u00a014(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of\u00a01934 and Rule 14a-9 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Selwood consented to a permanent injunction, to pay a $150,000 civil penalty, and to be prohibited from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for a period of three years. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Roberto Tercero and William Fiske, with the assistance of Ruth Pinkel, and supervised by Marc Blau and Douglas Miller.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

The SEC previously charged Babini and two other defendants with a scheme to defraud potential investors in Endeavor's publicly traded stock. The SEC's complaint alleged that Babini attempted to manipulate the market for Endeavor's stock by, among other things, engaging in coordinated trading designed to artificially inflate its price.\n\nOn September 27, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Babini, enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and Section 9(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, and prohibiting him from participating in the offering of a penny stock. In a parallel criminal case brought by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, after a three-year effort to extradite Babini from Canada, Babini pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud on December 20, 2023, and the court entered final judgment on March 18, 2024, order\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Marco Babini\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

William D. Carlton, No. 2:24-cv-01542 (W.D. Wash. filed Sept. 27, 2024)\n\n\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission v. Hans K. Hernandez, No. 3:24-cv-09487 (D.N.J. filed Sept. 27, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Investment Advisers for Conducting Fraudulent Cherry-Picking Schemes\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against William D. Carlton, a former investment adviser representative in Kirkland, Washington, and Hans K. Hernandez, a former investment adviser representative in Hillsborough, New Jersey, for each conducting separate multi-year cherry-picking schemes that defrauded their clients.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaints against Carlton and Hernandez, each profited at his clients' expense by cherry picking trades using personal trading accounts and observing the daily price movements of the securities. The complaints allege that each delayed allocating the securities until after he had observed the securities' price movement over the course of the trading day. By watching the price movements in their personal accounts before deciding whether to keep trades for themselves or allocate the trades to their clients, Carlton and Hernandez each allegedly disproportionately allocated profitable trades to their personal accounts and unprofitable trades to their clients' accounts. Between at least January 2015 and August 2022, Carlton allegedly generated approximately $5.3 million in illicit first-day profits through the scheme. Between at least July 2020 and February 2022, Hernandez allegedly generated more than $1 million in illicit first-day profits through the scheme.\n\nThe SEC's complaints against Carlton and Hernandez, filed in federal court in Washington and New Jersey respectively, charge each with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In both actions, the SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. In a related action, the SEC entered settled administrative and cease-and-desist orders for compliance failures against Cetera Investment Advisers LLC, a registered investment adviser based in Illinois, and First Allied Advisory Services, Inc., formerly a registered investment adviser based in California, with which Carlton and Hernandez were associated as investment adviser representatives.\n\nThe case originated from the Market Abuse Unit's (MAU) Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious trading patterns. The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Scheffler, Andrew Palid, and Michele T. Perillo of the MAU in the Boston Regional Office (BRO), with assistance from John Rymas of the MAU and Stuart Jackson and Stephen Graham of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigations will be led by Susan Cooke and David D'Addio of the BRO.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint - William D.

Akshay Kamboj and Dev Kamboj, No. (SDNY filed September 27, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Fund Principals With Pitching Fund Investors Using A Fake Performance History\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against brothers Akshay and Dev Kamboj, principals of the Crawford Ventures Absolute Return Fund (the \"Fund\"), with defrauding investors by using offering materials that fraudulently presented their trading track record. The Fund raised more than $16 million from investors in 2022 and 2023.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Fund told prospective investors that it would engage in currency trading using a successful strategy previously employed by Akshay and Dev Kamboj for other clients prior to the Fund's formation. As alleged in the complaint, the Kamboj brothers provided proof of the purported success of the strategy, including an \"Audit Report\" and a \"Performance Audit\" purportedly issued by an Australian audit and consulting firm. In reality, according to the complaint, the auditor had never performed an audit for the Kamboj brothers, and the Audit Report and the Performance Audit, which were furnished to a number of prospective investors, was fake. The complaint further alleges that the Kamboj brothers created a fictitious email address to impersonate the auditor in communications with potential investors.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Akshay and Dev Kamboj with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties.\n\nThe SEC is simultaneously bringing settled administrative charges against Evan H. Katz, a third principal of the Fund, for his misleading communications to prospective investors in the Fund.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Nicholas Flath, Rhonda L. Jung, Melissa Coppola, Ling Yu, Alistaire Bambach and Adam S. Grace, under the supervision of Sheldon L. Pollock, and the litigation will be led by Travis Hill, Mr. Flath and Ms. Jung, all of the New York Regional Office.

Cassava Sciences, Inc., Remi Barbier, and Lindsay Burns, No. 1:24-cv-01150 (W.D. Tex. filed Sept. 26, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Cassava Sciences, Two Former Executives for Misleading Claims About Alzheimer\u2019s Clinical Trial\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against Cassava Sciences, Inc., its founder and former CEO, Remi Barbier, and its former Senior Vice President of Neuroscience, Dr. Lindsay Burns, related to misleading statements made in September 2020 about the results of a Phase 2 clinical trial for the company\u2019s purported therapeutic for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that Cassava and Burns misled investors with claims that its Phase 2 trial was conducted in blinded conditions, even though the scientist testing the samples \u2013 who was also the co-inventor of the therapeutic \u2013 had been unblinded. The complaint further alleges that Cassava misled investors in announcing that the company\u2019s therapeutic significantly improved patient cognition. Among other things, Cassava claimed that the Phase 2 results showed significant improvement in episodic memory of the Alzheimer\u2019s patients involved in the clinical trial. But in reporting the results, Cassava failed to disclose that the full set of patient data \u2013 as opposed to the subset of data hand-selected by Burns \u2013 showed no measurable cognitive improvement in the patients\u2019 episodic memory. Cassava and Barbier also failed to disclose the therapeutic\u2019s co-inventor\u2019s role in the clinical trial, despite his personal, financial, and professional interest in the therapeutic\u2019s success.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, charges Cassava with violating Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. The complaint also charges Barbier and Burns with violating Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Cassava, Barbier, and Dr. Burns agreed to consent to the entry of final judgments, subject to court approval, enjoining them from committing or engaging in future violations. They have also agreed to pay civil penalties of $40 million, $175,000, and $85,000 respectively. Barbier and Burns agreed to be subject to officer-and-director bars of three and five years, respectively.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Matthew Spitzer, Ernesto Amparo, and Zachary Avallone and was assisted by Eugene Canjels from the Commission\u2019s Division of Economic Risk and Analysis. The investigation was supervised by Sarah Hall, Melissa Armstrong, and Mr. Cave.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

The final judgments also order Patel and Chitor to disgorge the illicit gains that they made in their own accounts and in other accounts that they controlled \u2013 $423,074 for Patel and $1,244,801 for Chitor \u2013 with prejudgment interest thereon, the payment of which was deemed satisfied by forfeiture orders entered in the parallel criminal actions. \n\nThe litigation was led by Joshua R.

On November 15, 2022, Garcia consented to, without admitting or denying the Commission\u2019s allegations, a permanent injunction from violating the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, with penalties and disgorgement amounts to be determined at a later date.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint against Fernandez, a Florida licensed attorney and former manager and sales agents for MJ Capital, Fernandez managed a team of over 60 sales agents who solicited investors nationwide on behalf of MJ Capital and MJ Taxes. The SEC\u2019s complaint also alleges that between November 2020 and August 2021, Fernandez personally raised at least $891,000 from about 89 investors and received approximately $362,000 in commission payments from MJ Capital for these sales of securities, which commissions were paid using investor money. As alleged in the complaint, Fernandez solicited investors through Zoom meetings, and postings and live meetings on her Instagram page. The SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that Fernandez negligently made materially false and misleading statements in two videos she created and disseminated to prospective investors and to the sales agents on her team. Specifically, the SEC alleges that Fernandez falsely claimed that MJ Capital was not operating a Ponzi scheme and that she made misleading statements about her own investment in MJ Capital\u2019s securities offering. The complaint against Fernandez further alleges that she illegally acted as an unregistered broker while offering and selling MJ Capital and MJ Taxes\u2019 unregistered securities to the public.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaints against Rosas, Guayara, Ruiz, and Duarte, four of MJ Capital\u2019s top-selling sales agents, allege that they collectively offered and sold at least $18 million in MJ Capital\u2019s unregistered securities to at least 1,427 investors. According to the complaints, the defendants marketed the securities to investors and collectively earned millions of dollars in commissions on their sales, even though they were not registered as broker-dealers or associated with registered broker dealers.\n\nThe SEC charges Fernandez with violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and the broker-dealer registration provision of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC also charges Rosas, Guayara, Ruiz, and Duarte with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Fernandez, Rosas, Guayara, Ruiz, and Duarte.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Raynette R. Nicoleau and Julia D\u2019Antonio in the Miami Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Fernando Torres, and Glenn S. Gordon. The SEC\u2019s litigation is being led by Stephanie N. Moot under the supervision of Teresa Verges.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint - Leonela M.

(\u201cCanaFarma\u201d) raised millions of dollars from investors.\u00a0 While raising these funds purportedly to operate CanaFarma, Fargesen allegedly made misrepresentations to investors, including claims that CanaFarma was a fully integrated company that was processing hemp from its own farm when in fact it had not processed any of this hemp and its products used hemp supplied by third parties.\u00a0 The amended complaint further alleges that Fargesen directed changes to CanaFarma\u2019s financial model in order to disguise an expected series of payments to himself.\u00a0 Additionally, the amended complaint alleges that Fargesen misappropriated investor funds.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged Fargesen with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\u00a0 On August 14, 2024, the Court entered a partial consent judgment against Fargesen in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions and agreed to an officer-and-director bar.\u00a0 On September 20, 2024, the Court entered a final consent judgment against Fargesen in which he agreed to pay disgorgement of $828,287 and prejudgment interest of $144,542.81, the payment of which was deemed satisfied by the amended restitution order in the parallel criminal proceeding, United States v. Fargesen, 21 cr. 602 (S.D.N.Y.).\u00a0 Fargesen also agreed to be barred from participating in an offering of penny stock.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation is being conducted by John C.

Christopher Beals and Arden Lee, No. 2:24-cv-08215 (C.D. Cal. filed Sept. 24, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Public Company WM Technology, Inc. and Two Former Senior Executives with Making Negligent Misrepresentations Regarding the \u201cMonthly Active Users\u201d on the Company\u2019s Online Cannabis Marketplace\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission charged public company WM Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MAPS), its former CEO, Christopher Beals, and its former CFO, Arden Lee, for making negligent misrepresentations in WM Technology's public reporting of a self-described key operating metric, the \"monthly active users,\" or \"MAU,\" for WM Technology's online cannabis marketplace.\n\nThe SEC's complaint against Beals and Lee alleges that from May 2021 to May 2022, including during a merger with a special purpose acquisition company through which WM Technology became a public company in June 2021, WM Technology misleadingly reported substantial and continued MAU growth and emphasized the strength and expansion of its user base in its public filings and earnings calls. According to the complaint, although WM Technology's SEC filings stated that it determined its MAU by counting the total number of users that had \"engaged with\" the WM Technology site in a given period, in truth, a large and increasing percentage of the users of the WM Technology site were instead persons who visited a third-party site, and who were then automatically shown the WM Technology site by way of a \"pop-under\" advertisement. As alleged by the SEC, these purportedly \"active\" users did not volitionally seek out the WM Technology site, and, in most instances, did not click on any links or engage in measurable activity on the WM Technology site. The SEC's complaint further alleges that despite the publicly reported growth in MAU, WM Technology's user engagement metrics were stagnant or declining. The SEC also alleges that Beals and Lee were repeatedly advised of these declining user trends on the WM Technology site and the fact that these non-engaging users were making up an increasingly large percentage of WM Technology's total MAU, but failed to reasonably follow up and negligently continued to sign WM Technology's SEC filings and make public statements that reported MAU numbers that included non-engaging users when discussing the company's purportedly growing user base.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Beals and Lee have each consented to the entry of judgments against them, which are subject to court approval, under which they will be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 thereunder. Beals and Lee have each also consented to three-year officer-and-director bars and to pay civil penalties of $175,000.\n\nThe SEC also instituted a related settled administrative proceeding against WM Technology. Without admitting or denying the findings, WM Technology agreed to the entry of a cease-and-desist order prohibiting further violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13a-15(a), and 14a-9 thereunder. WM Technology also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1,500,000. In determining to accept the settlement of WM Technology, the SEC took into consideration WM Technology's substantial cooperation during the SEC's investigation.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Christopher Nowlin and supervised by Spencer E. Bendell of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Cal. filed Sept. 24, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Crypto Companies TrustToken and TrueCoin With Defrauding Investors Regarding Stablecoin Investment Program\n\n\n\nOn September 24, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced settled charges against TrueCoin LLC and TrustToken Inc. for their fraudulent and unregistered sales of investment contracts involving TrueUSD (\"TUSD\"), a purported stablecoin.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, TrueCoin was an issuer of TUSD and TrustToken was the developer and operator of TrueFi, a so-called lending protocol. The SEC's complaint alleges that from November 2020 until April 2023, TrueCoin and TrustToken engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts in the form of the crypto asset TUSD and profit-making opportunities with respect to TrueUSD on TrueFi in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The complaint further alleges that, in violation of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, TrueCoin and TrustToken falsely marketed the investment opportunity as safe and trustworthy by claiming that TUSD was fully backed by U.S. dollars or their equivalent, when in fact a substantial portion of the assets purportedly backing TUSD had been invested in a speculative and risky offshore investment fund to earn additional returns for the defendants. The complaint alleges that, by approximately March 2022, after the TUSD operations had been sold to an offshore entity, that entity and TrueCoin had invested more than half a billion dollars of the assets purportedly backing TUSD in the speculative fund, and that, by Fall 2022, TrueCoin and TrustToken became aware of redemption problems at the offshore fund but continued to make false statements to investors casting TUSD as backed one-for-one by U.S. dollars. As alleged, by September 2024, 99% of the reserves backing TUSD were invested in the speculative fund.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, TrueCoin and TrustToken agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of final judgments enjoining them from violating applicable provisions of the federal securities laws and to pay civil penalties of $163,766 each. TrueCoin agreed to pay disgorgement of $340,930 with prejudgment interest of $31,538. The settlements are subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation, which is ongoing, was conducted by Michael C. Baker, Michael Friedman, Pasha Salimi, and Bryan Hsueh.

The complaint alleged that Lindsay's co-defendant Eric Watson, a Long Blockchain insider who had signed a confidentiality agreement not to disclose the company's business plans, tipped Lindsay about Long Blockchain's unannounced plans to pivot to blockchain technology. The complaint further alleged that Lindsay then tipped his friend and co-defendant, Gannon Giguiere, who purchased 35,000 shares of Long Blockchain stock within hours of receiving confidential information about Long Blockchain from Lindsay. According to the complaint, the company's stock price skyrocketed after a press release was issued announcing its shift to blockchain technology. The complaint further alleged that within two hours of the announcement, Giguiere sold his shares for over $160,000 in illicit profits.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lindsay consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $75,000.\n\nThe SEC's litigation is being led by Chevon Walker, Mary Kay Dunning, and Lindsay S.

Barry Siegel, No. 1:24-CV-7210 (S.D.N.Y. filed September 24, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges Former Foot Locker Employee with Insider Trading\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission charged New York resident Barry Siegel with insider trading ahead of two earnings announcements by Foot Locker, Inc.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Siegel had access to material nonpublic sales and inventory data in his role as Senior Director of Order Planning Management, North America at Foot Locker. The SEC alleges while in that role, Siegel shorted Foot Locker stock in advance of the company\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings announcement in May 2023. The SEC further alleges that, after the announcement, Foot Locker\u2019s stock price fell by 27.24%, and Siegel covered his short position for a $82,736.06 profit. The complaint further alleges, in early August 2023, about a week after being laid off from his job at Foot Locker, Siegel sold short Foot Locker stock again, this time in advance of the company\u2019s announcement of its second quarter 2023 earnings. According to the complaint, after that announcement, the stock price fell by 28.28% and Siegel covered his short position for a $30,132.89 profit. The SEC further alleges that before each of his trades, Siegel was in possession of material nonpublic information concerning Foot Locker\u2019s operating results, including negative sales and inventory figures, and that he traded based on that information despite being subject to Foot Locker\u2019s Policy Prohibiting Insider Trading.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Siegel with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Siegel consented to a judgment, subject to court approval, permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions; ordering him to pay disgorgement of $112,868.95 plus prejudgment interest of $9,975.97; imposing a civil monetary penalty of $112,868.95; and barring him from acting or serving as an officer or director of a public company.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Jeremy Brandt, Wes Wintermyer, Matthew Lambert, and Lauren Sheridan of the SEC\u2019s New York Regional Office, and was supervised by Celeste Chase and Sheldon Pollock.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Benjamin Ballout, Mohamed Zayed, and William Fielding, No. 9:24-cv-81170 (S.D. Fla. filed Sept. 23, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges CEO and Two Others in Penny-Stock Fraud Scheme\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Michigan resident Benjamin Ballout, Egypt resident Mohamed Zayed, and Florida resident William Fielding for their roles in a fraudulent scheme to pump and dump the publicly traded stock of Enerkon Solar International, Inc. (\"Enerkon\").\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that in 2021, Ballout, who served as Enerkon's CEO, authored, approved, and issued at least three press releases that falsely claimed that Enerkon had acquired a company with distribution rights to a Covid-19 instant test; received a $28 million purchase order for the Covid-19 tests; and entered into an agreement to buy commercial property to build a large solar and hydrogen plant. Zayed allegedly participated in the scheme by fabricating a bogus purchase order to evidence the non-existent $28 million purchase order for the Covid-19 test. In June 2021, the Commission suspended trading in Enerkon's stock.\n\nThe SEC's complaint further alleges that, prior to the trading suspension, Fielding and Zayed coordinated with Ballout to profit from the artificially inflated price of Enerkon's stock using a phony convertible promissory note that Enerkon purportedly issued to Fielding in exchange for a $180,000 loan. According to the complaint, Fielding never loaned $180,000 to Enerkon, and the promissory note was backdated to 2017 and signed by Ballout, even though Ballout was not affiliated with Enerkon in 2017. In March 2021, Enerkon's transfer agent allegedly received an email from a Fielding email account, instructing the transfer agent to convert the bogus promissory note into free-trading shares of Enerkon stock. The complaint alleges that the email attached a fabricated statement from Fielding's bank account and other false records, purporting to evidence the non-existent loan. Relying on these false documents, the complaint alleges that the transfer agent issued Enerkon stock to Fielding as instructed. In transactions coordinated and negotiated on his behalf by Zayed and Ballout, Fielding allegedly sold 2.6 million Enerkon shares to a third-party investor for $407,000 in May 2021, paying $96,000 of his trading proceeds to Zayed for his role in the fraudulent scheme.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. Against each defendant, the SEC seeks permanent injunctions from future violations of these provisions, penny-stock bars, and civil penalties. The SEC also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Ballout and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest from Zayed and Fielding. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Fielding has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these antifraud provisions; imposes a penny-stock bar; orders disgorgement of $311,000 plus prejudgment interest of $53,230.28; and imposes a civil penalty of $195,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Derek B. Kleinmann, Kathleen V. Galloway, and Ty Martinez and supervised by Timothy S. McCole and B. David Fraser of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Patrick B. Disbennett and supervised by Keefe M.

James Douglas Miller, No. 18-cv-05761 (W.D. Wash. filed Sept. 20, 2018)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Former CFO for Accounting Failures\n\nOn September 11, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against defendant James Douglas Miller, the former Chief Financial Officer of Barrett Business Services, Inc. (\u201cBBSI\u201d), whom the SEC previously charged for his alleged role in an accounting fraud involving the company\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation expenses.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint was filed on September 20, 2018 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The complaint alleged that Miller made accounting entries to misclassify BBSI\u2019s expenses. These accounting entries allegedly caused BBSI to under-report its workers\u2019 compensation expenses. According to the complaint, BBSI ultimately restated its annual and interim financial reports for periods between 2011 and 2015, which had all been originally filed when Miller was the CFO.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Miller consented to the entry of a final judgment: (1) permanently enjoining him from violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Exchange Act Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2(b); (2) permanently enjoining Miller from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13; (3) imposing a permanent bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company; and (4) ordering him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $35,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was handled by Rahul Kolhatkar and Sheila O\u2019Callaghan, both of the San Francisco Regional Office.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Swaffer, et. al., No. 1:22-cv-1554 (N.D. Ohio September 1, 2022)\n\nCourt Enters Final Judgments Against All Defendants in Marijuana Company Fraud\u00a0\n\nOn September 5, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio entered final judgments by consent against Kris A. Swaffer (\u201cSwaffer\u201d), the president of POHIH, Inc., and Sean K. Williams, the chief operating officer of a related entity, and relief defendant Rosalyn K. Swaffer. On September 13, 2024, the Court also entered a final default judgment against POHIH.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on September 1, 2022, alleges that, from at least September 2016 through February 2020, Swaffer and Williams, through POHIH and other now-defunct related entities, raised approximately $14 million from approximately 75 investors in at least 14 states for a start-up marijuana business with operations in Europe, through a series of unregistered securities offerings. According to the complaint, while some funds raised from investors went to fund operations, Swaffer and Williams misappropriated investor funds for personal use while also misrepresenting the risks associated with investment. The complaint alleges that Swaffer misappropriated at least $2.4 million for his personal use between September 2016 and March 2020. The complaint also asserts that Williams, in addition to being aware of Swaffer\u2019s misappropriation, himself misappropriated investor funds for personal use between April 2017 and January 2020. Finally, the complaint alleges relief defendant Rosalyn K. Swaffer received ill-gotten gains to which she had no legitimate claim.\n\nThe final judgments against Swaffer and Williams, which were entered by consent and without admitting or denying the allegations, enjoin Swaffer and Williams from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 5 of the Securities Act. The judgments also bar Swaffer and Williams from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act.\u00a0\n\nSwaffer was also ordered to pay $2,318,981 in disgorgement, $513,982 in prejudgment interest, and a $2.25 million civil penalty. Williams was ordered to pay $931,662 in disgorgement, $206,945 in prejudgment interest, and an $880,000 civil penalty.\u00a0\n\nThe final judgment against relief defendant Rosalyn K. Swaffer, also entered by consent, orders her to pay $865,707 in disgorgement and $191,877 in prejudgment interest. Of the total amounts ordered against Swaffer and relief defendant Rosalyn K. Swaffer, they are jointly and severally liable for $676,362 in disgorgement and $149,910 in prejudgment interest.\n\nThe final default judgment against POHIH permanently enjoins POHIH from future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act and orders POHIH to pay a $115,231 civil penalty.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation in this matter is now concluded.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Matthew T.

DiScala et al., No. 1:14-cv-04346 (E.D.N.Y. filed July 17, 2014; amended Jan. 19, 2016).\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Eighth Defendant in CodeSmart Fraud\n\nOn September 13, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment against Abraxas (A.J.) DiScala, enjoining him from violating certain provisions of the federal securities laws and imposing other remedies.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Discala, the CEO and president of a purported merchant banking firm, worked with certain of his co-defendants, including two registered representatives of different broker-dealers, to inflate the price of the stock of CodeSmart, Inc.

On September 13, 2024, the Court entered a final consent judgment against DiScala in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions and to an officer-and-director and penny stock bar.\u00a0DiScala further agreed to disgorge over $2.4 million in ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest thereon, the payment of which was deemed satisfied by the restitution order in the parallel criminal proceeding, United States v.

Sept. 18, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges Phoenix, Arizona-Based Investment Adviser for Conducting Fraudulent \u201cCherry-Picking\u201d Scheme\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Raymond J. DiMuro, a former principal of Your Source Financial, PLC, a formerly SEC-registered investment adviser based in Phoenix, Arizona, with defrauding clients by conducting a cherry-picking scheme.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from at least January 2018 to January 2022, DiMuro principally traded for Your Source clients by placing securities trades through a block trading account; block accounts facilitate purchases of securities for multiple client accounts.\u00a0 As alleged by the SEC, however, DiMuro placed trades throughout the trading day but did not allocate portions of the block trades until later in the trading day, which allowed DiMuro to consider whether the traded security had gone up or down in price since the block trade had been executed in determining how to allocate the block trade.\u00a0 The complaint alleges that DiMuro disproportionately allocated profitable trades to three favored clients and unprofitable trades to other Your Source clients.\u00a0 According to the complaint, as a result of DiMuro\u2019s cherry-picking, DiMuro\u2019s favored clients received over $785,000 in day-of-trade profits and Your Source\u2019s other clients suffered over $1 million in day-of-trade losses.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, charges DiMuro with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c) thereunder, Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\u00a0 Without admitting or denying the allegations, DiMuro consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions and imposing a $750,000 civil money penalty.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by the staff of the Los Angeles Regional Office, with assistance from Carmen Taveras and Jason Lee in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Daniel Blau and supervised by Douglas Miller.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Philip Markin, No. 1:24-cv-06831 (S.D.N.Y. filed Sept. 10, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Reaches Settlement with Fifth Individual Charged In Insider Trading Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Philip Markin, the fifth individual charged in connection with an insider trading scheme to trade ahead of a pharmaceutical company tender offer.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on September 10, 2024, Philip Markin made approximately $16,362 from illegally trading ahead of the February 2021 announcement of a tender offer by Merck & Co., Inc., to acquire Pandion Therapeutics, Inc. The SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that Philip Markin was tipped about the deal by his cousin, Seth Markin, who misappropriated the material nonpublic information from his then-romantic partner, who worked as an associate for a law firm representing Merck. The SEC previously charged Seth Markin with insider trading on July 25, 2022. Philip Markin also tipped a friend, Jonathan Becker, who the SEC charged on September 20, 2023.\n\nThe case originated from the SEC Enforcement Division\u2019s Market Abuse Unit Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious trading patterns.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charges Philip Markin with violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Philip Markin consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, that would permanently enjoin him from violating the charged provisions, and order him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $32,724.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Tracy Sivitz and John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit, and by Chevon Walker and Neil Hendelman of the New York Regional Office. This case has been supervised by Market Abuse Unit Chief Joseph G. Sansone.

Prager Metis CPAs, LLC, No. 1:24-cv-07025 (S.D.N.Y. filed Sept. 17, 2024)\n\nAudit Firm Prager Metis Settles SEC Charges for Negligence in FTX Audits\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Prager Metis CPAs, LLC (Prager) agreed to pay $745,000 to resolve an action alleging misconduct in its audits of the now-defunct crypto asset trading platform FTX Trading Ltd. (FTX).\n\nThe SEC alleges that Prager misrepresented its compliance with auditing standards regarding FTX.\u00a0 According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from February 2021 to April 2022, Prager issued two audit reports for FTX that falsely misrepresented that the audits complied with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS). The SEC alleges that Prager failed to follow GAAS and its own policies and procedures by, among other deficiencies, not adequately assessing whether it had the competency and resources to undertake the audit of FTX. According to the complaint, this quality control failure led to Prager failing to comply with GAAS in multiple aspects of the audit\u2014most significantly by failing to understand the increased risk stemming from the relationship between FTX and Alameda Research LLC, a crypto hedge fund controlled by FTX\u2019s CEO.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charges Prager with violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings, Prager agreed to permanent injunctions, to pay a $745,000 civil penalty, and to undertake remedial actions, including retaining an independent consultant to review and evaluate its audit, review, and quality control policies and procedures and abiding by certain restrictions on accepting new audit clients. \u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ongoing investigation as to Prager\u2019s audits of FTX is being conducted by Amy Burkart, David D\u2019Addio, Devlin N.

Joel David Castro Leon and Shmuel A. Sherr, No. 2:24-cv-09214 (D.N.J. filed Sept. 17, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Two Israeli Residents with Manipulative Spoofing Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Israeli residents Joel David Castro Leon and Shmuel A. Sherr for carrying out a manipulative trading scheme that netted them over $415,000 in profits.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed in the District of New Jersey, Leon, with Sherr's assistance, engaged in manipulative trading practices known as spoofing to ensure that he could buy stocks at artificially low prices and sell the same stocks at artificially high prices. The complaint alleges Sherr opened brokerage accounts in his name and allowed Leon to trade in those accounts. The complaint further alleges Leon placed a series of non-bona fide orders to buy or sell stock. According to the complaint, the purpose of these orders - which Leon did not intend to execute - was to create a false appearance of market interest to increase or decrease the market price of the stock. After artificially inflating or depressing the market price of a particular stock, Leon allegedly bought or sold the stock at advantageous prices. The complaint alleges they shared the trading profits 90% to Leon and 10% to Sherr.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Leon and Sherr with violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. The complaint also charges Leon with violating Section 9(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and charges Sherr with aiding and abetting Leon's violations. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Leon and Sherr consented to the entry of final judgments, subject to court approval, that would permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions and order disgorgement against Leon and Sherr in the amounts of $373,581 and $41,509, respectively, plus prejudgment interest. The final judgments would also order Leon and Sherr to pay civil penalties of $125,000 and $14,000, respectively, and prohibit Leon, for a period of five years, and Sherr, for a period of three years, from, directly or indirectly, opening, maintaining, or trading in any brokerage account(s) in their names, the names of any immediate family members, the names of any company over which they have any control, or the names of any third party individual(s), without providing the relevant broker-dealer(s) a copy of the complaint and final judgments entered against them.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Han Nguyen, Matthew Koop, and Julia C. Green of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit in the Philadelphia Regional Office under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, with the assistance of trial counsel Judson Mihok under the supervision of Gregory Bockin.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Coen, the company's former audit committee chair, for their roles in a scheme in which Kubient overstated and misrepresented its revenue in connection with two public stock offerings.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint against Roberts, shortly before Kubient's initial public offering, Roberts fabricated reports that Kubient had successfully tested a software program that detects real-time fraud during digital advertising auctions, allowing Kubient to recognize $1.3 million in revenue, which was nearly all of its revenue leading up to the offering. The complaint alleges that Kubient did not actually perform the tests and thus should not have recognized the revenue. In a separate complaint, the SEC alleges that Weiss and Coen learned during Kubient's secondary stock offering that the tests had not been performed, but instead of investigating or correcting the misrepresentations, Weiss and Coen perpetuated the schemeby making false statements about the revenue at issue. Additionally, Roberts, Weiss, and Coen allegedly each lied to Kubient's independent auditor about the revenue or whether they had become aware of any concerns about it. According to the SEC's complaints, Kubient raised approximately $33 million in the two stock offerings using offering materials that touted the misrepresentations about the success of the tests and the revenue.\n\nThe SEC's complaints, both of which were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charge Roberts, Weiss, and Coen with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting Kubient's violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and various rules thereunder. Roberts and Weiss are also charged with making false certifications under Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, and aiding and abetting Kubient's violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13b(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The complaints seek injunctions, officer-and-director bars, civil penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and other relief. In a partial settlement, Roberts has consented to injunctions from future violations of the charged provisions while agreeing to litigate the appropriate remedies. His settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nIn a parallel criminal matter, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Roberts.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Jeffrey S. Lyons, Emily C. Scruggs, and Donna B. Walker, and supervised by Ian S. Karpel, Nicholas P. Heinke, and Jason J. Burt. The litigation will be led by Jodanna Haskins and Ian Kellogg and supervised by Gregory A. Kasper, Mr. Heinke, and Mr. Burt.\n\nThe SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint - Paul D.

Scott J. Hollender, Gabriel F. Migliano, Jr. and Frank M. Vecchio), No. 1:23-cv-02456 (S.D.N.Y. filed Mar. 23, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Imposing Over $600,000 in Monetary Relief Against Alleged Unregistered Broker\n\n\n\nOn September 10, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final consent judgment against Frank M. Vecchio, enjoining him from violating certain provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering disgorgement and civil monetary penalties.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on March 23, 2023, alleged that between August 2018 and November 2021, Vecchio actively solicited investments for interests in shares of pre-IPO companies on behalf of StraightPath Venture Partners LLC through funds that were set up as series LLCs, each of which purported to acquire shares of a single pre-IPO company. Vecchio allegedly provided investors with marketing materials, advised investors on the supposed merits of the investments, and received transaction-based compensation, all hallmarks of a broker, despite not being registered as a broker. As alleged in the complaint, Vecchio solicited at least $2.7 million in investments from at least 21 investors, and even though Vecchio received upfront commissions of approximately 10 percent on investments he successfully solicited, Vecchio falsely told investors that there were no upfront fees associated with their investments. According to the complaint, Vecchio received at least approximately $479,000 in transaction-based compensation.\n\nThe final judgment enjoins Vecchio from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a)] and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a078j(b); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(a)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5]. The judgment orders Vecchio to pay disgorgement of $479,821.84 with prejudgment interest thereon of $64,427.93 and imposes a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $90,000.00.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation in this matter is ongoing with respect to the remaining defendants.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation is being led by Sushila P. Rao and Michael S. DiBattista of the New York Regional Office, with assistance from Megan R. Genet, Tian Wen, Douglas J. Smith, and Steven G. Rawlings, and is being supervised by Sheldon L.

Dishant Gupta, No. 1:24-civ-12316 (D. Mass filed Sept. 10, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Biopharmaceutical Company Employee with Insider Trading\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged New Jersey resident Dishant Gupta with insider trading ahead of an announcement that Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Gupta's employer, had agreed to acquire Epizyme, Inc.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Gupta allegedly became aware of Ipsen's interest in acquiring Epizyme or its premier drug months before the transaction was publicly announced. Gupta allegedly purchased Epizyme shares while aware of that material non-public information and, after the announcement was made, sold the shares realizing approximately $260,000 in illegal profits.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Gupta with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer and director bar. Gupta has consented to the entry of a judgment that enjoins him from violating the charged provisions and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Monetary relief is to be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nIn a parallel action concerning the same conduct, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today filed criminal charges against Gupta.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Nicholas Karasimas, Melissa Coppola, and Sandeep Satwalekar, and supervised by Thomas P.

Donald Anthony Wright and Retirement Specialty Group, Inc., No. 2:24-cv-00065 (M.D. Tenn. filed Sept. 9, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges Tennessee Investment Adviser and its Owner with Religious Affinity Fraud\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged Cookeville, Tennessee resident Donald Anthony Wright and his company, Retirement Specialty Group, Inc., an SEC-registered investment adviser, with defrauding several investors.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Wright primarily targeted Christian clients by promoting his and Retirement Specialty Group\u2019s \u201cfaith-based\u201d approach to investing. Between approximately June 2021 and July 2023, Wright and Retirement Specialty Group allegedly recommended and sold over $2 million in fraudulent promissory notes to at least five advisory clients and one other investor. In recommending and selling these notes, some of which promised monthly interest of up to 20%, Wright allegedly misled investors concerning the nature and safety of investing in the notes. For example, Wright allegedly claimed that: the notes were secured by real estate; investments in the notes were safer and more stable than investments in the stock market; and Wright personally had invested substantial funds in the notes. According to the complaint, all of these claims were false. The complaint further alleges that, after selling the notes, Wright misappropriated most of the note proceeds for his own personal benefit and then lied to the investors about the repayment status of the notes. For example, after one of the notes defaulted, Wright allegedly fabricated an $8.1 million wire-transfer confirmation that he gave to a client to falsely assure him that repayment of his note was forthcoming. Wright also allegedly failed to disclose his business and financial ties with the issuers of the notes, which created conflicts of interest. Notably, the complaint claims that, on at least three occasions, Wright obtained investor funds by creating and using fake promissory notes that were not issued by any company.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, charges Wright and Retirement Specialty Group with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Wright and Retirement Specialty Group each consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions and authorizing the Court to determine at a later date the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties that each defendant shall pay. Wright also consented to a permanent officer-and-director bar and to an injunction that permanently bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nInvestors should be aware that many fraudsters try to take advantage of the trust that having something in common creates, such as a common religion. The SEC\u2019s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert with tips on how investors should be wary of making decisions based solely on common ties with someone recommending or selling the investment.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation, conducted by enforcement staff in the Atlanta Regional Office, was part of the Atlanta Regional Office\u2019s Atlanta Area Affinity Fraud Initiative. Yolanda Ross and Cody Turley conducted the investigation, which was supervised by Thomas Bosch and Justin Jeffries. Shawn Murnahan, supervised by M.

Raskob Kambourian Financial Advisors, Ltd., No. 4:24-cv-00442-MSA (D. Ariz. filed September 5, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Investment Adviser for Failing to Disclose Fee Increases to Clients\n\n\n\nOn September 5, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Raskob Kambourian Financial Advisors, Ltd. (\"Raskob Kambourian\"), a formerly SEC registered investment adviser based in Tucson, Arizona, with breaching its fiduciary duties by failing to disclose financial planning and investment management fee increases to its clients.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, during the period of May 2019 through July 2022, Raskob Kambourian charged its clients fees that were higher than the amounts set forth in its clients' respective agreements. The SEC alleges that Raskob Kambourian periodically increased its fees, but, as a matter of general practice, did not expressly disclose those fee increases to clients, in breach of the firm's fiduciary duties. Additionally, according to the SEC's complaint, the SEC's \"brochure rule\" required Raskob Kambourian to disclose each fee increase as a \"material change\" to its Form ADV Part 2A (the \"Brochure\") that the firm filed with the SEC on an annual basis. The brochure rule further required Raskob Kambourian to deliver to each client, within 120 days of the end of the firm's fiscal year, its current Brochure, or, a summary of material changes to its Brochure with an offer to deliver the full Brochure. The SEC alleges that Raskob Kambourian failed to satisfy this requirement in each year from 2019-2022. According to the SEC's complaint, Raskob Kambourian charged approximately 59 clients a total of $1,364,513 more in fees than were authorized under the fee schedules set forth in its clients' respective agreements.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, charges Raskob Kambourian with violating Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"), as well as the record-keeping, delivery, and compliance provisions of Sections 204(a) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rules 204-2, 204-3, and 206(4)-7 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Raskob Kambourian consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, permanently enjoining it from future violations of the charged provisions; ordering Raskob Kambourian to pay disgorgement of $1,364,513 plus prejudgment interest thereon of $256,068; and imposing a civil money penalty of $225,000.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Robert C. Stillwell and supervised by Finola H. Manvelian of the Los Angeles office. The litigation will be led by Daniel S. Lim and supervised by Douglas M. Miller. The SEC's examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric Lee and supervised by Andy Sohrn and Tamara Heller.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Toller Stern Financial LLC, et al., No. 1:24-cv-23370 (S.D. Fla. filed Sept. 3, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges Two South Florida Men and Related Entity with Fraud\n\n\n\nToday, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Miami-area residents Francisco Javier Malave Hernandez (\"Malave\") and Ricardo Javier Guerra Farias (\"Guerra\") and a company Malave controlled with defrauding investors who purchased approximately $5 million in promissory notes. Most of the investors are members of the Venezuelan-American community and this case is part of the Miami Regional Office's Fraud Against Minority Groups Initiative.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, Malave and Guerra used three entities, including Toller Stern Financial LLC, to raise money from retail investors for the purported purpose of investing the money using a Toller Stern automated trading platform. The complaint further alleges Malave, Guerra, and Toller Stern raised this money through the fraudulent and unregistered offer and sale of promissory notes, promising annualized interest rates of 24% to 72%. As alleged in the complaint, Malave and Guerra represented to investors that the promissory notes were safe because they were secured by company assets and that Malave and Guerra had more than $20 million in combined assets under management. In reality, the complaint alleges, among other things, the companies had no real assets other than the money provided by investors and that Malave, Guerra, and Toller Stern diverted new investor money to make interest payments to existing investors and to pay themselves.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges Malave, Guerra, and Toller Stern with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further charges Malave and Toller Stern with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Malave, Guerra, and Toller Stern consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, which would permanently enjoin each of them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and would further permanently enjoin Malave and Toller Stern from violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act. The final judgment, if approved by the court, also would impose officer and director bars against Malave and Guerra; order Malave to pay disgorgement of $558,900, prejudgment interest of $158,087 and a civil penalty of $200,000; order Guerra to pay disgorgement of $147,152, prejudgment interest of $29,223 and a civil penalty of $200,000; and order Toller Stern to pay disgorgement of $748,300, prejudgment interest of $211,660 and a civil penalty of $1 million.\n\nJohn T.

Shaohua (Michael) Yin, et al., Civil Action No. 1:17-cv-00972-JPO (S.D.N.Y.)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Imposing a $39.5 Million Penalty Against Chinese National Charged with Insider Trading\n\n\n\nOn August 16, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against defendant Shaohua (Michael) Yin, including a penalty of $39.5 million paid out of funds frozen in the brokerage accounts that Yin allegedly used to engage in insider trading. The SEC previously charged Yin with reaping massive profits from insider trading in the shares of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation and DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc.\n\nThe SEC's amended complaint alleged that in the weeks leading up to the April 2016 acquisition of DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. by Comcast Corp., Yin amassed more than $56 million of DreamWorks stock in the U.S. brokerage accounts of five nominees, all of whom were Chinese nationals. DreamWorks' stock price rose 47.3% once the acquisition was announced. The five accounts allegedly reaped $29 million in illicit profits from the DreamWorks trades. According to the amended complaint, later that year, from July to November 2016, Yin again used the same five nominee accounts to acquire more than $44 million of Lattice stock. Following an early November 2016 announcement that Lattice was being acquired by Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, Inc., the company's stock price increased by over 18%. According to the SEC's amended complaint, Yin obtained another $7 million in alleged insider trading profits from his Lattice trading. Yin, then a partner at a Hong Kong-based private equity firm, allegedly did not trade in DreamWorks and Lattice stock through his own brokerage account, but instead traded through the five nominee accounts from addresses in Beijing and Palo Alto and on a computer that also accessed Yin's email accounts.\n\nThe final judgment imposes a $39.5 million penalty on Yin, to be paid out of the funds frozen at the outset of this action. Yin is also permanently restrained and enjoined from violating of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n\nOn August 25, 2022, judgment was entered against Benjamin Bin Chow, who the SEC alleged to be Yin's source of material non-public information for the Lattice trades, enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. On September 8, 2022, Chow was barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Previously, Chow was convicted of criminal violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, Conspiracy to Commit Securities Fraud, and violations of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78ff, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5 and 240.10b-5(2), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, Securities Fraud, in connection with the Lattice trades. United States v. Chow, Case No. 1:17-cr-00667-GHW (S.D.N.Y.).\n\nThe SEC's litigation in this matter is now concluded.\n\nThe SEC's enforcement action was litigated by Gary Y. Leung, Daniel O. Blau, Donald W. Searles, Jasmine M. Starr, and Douglas M. Miller of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office and Paul Alvarez of the SEC's Office of General Counsel, with assistance from Matthew Greiner, Bonnie Kartzman, and Sandy Medina-Henderson of the SEC's Office of International Affairs and Jan Jindra of the SEC's Division of Economic Research and Analysis.

According to the complaint, the brokerage services that the GEL entities provided included taking possession of customer securities, directing trades to executing brokers, facilitating trade settlements, and disbursing trading proceeds to customers. The SEC also alleged that, in return for these services, the defendants received transaction-based and other compensation from their customers.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgments, which enjoin the defendants from future violations of the broker-registration requirements of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, bar the GEL entities from participating in any offerings of a penny stock, and impose civil penalties of $750,000 against GEL Direct LLC and $98,000 each against Galvani and Jeffery.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by Keefe Bernstein, Catherine Rowsey, and Jaime Marinaro of the SEC\u2019s Fort Worth Regional Office, and was supervised by Derek Kleinmann and B.

Justin D. Smith and Joshua Constantin, No. 2:24-cv-06004 (E.D.N.Y. filed Aug. 27, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Former Healthcare Company Executives with Fraud\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Justin D. Smith and Joshua Constantin with defrauding investors of at least $2.7 million, making materially false and misleading statements in SEC filings, and aiding and abetting the making of such misstatements. The SEC previously charged Constantin with securities fraud in 2011 in connection with a separate investment scheme, for which the court found him liable on all claims.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, between at least November 2017 and February 2023, Constantin and Smith solicited investments in Healthcare Solutions Holdings, Inc., and its successor-in-interest, Healthcare Solutions Management Group, Inc., whose common stock was quoted on OTC Markets, by fabricating more than $75 million in assets, falsely reflecting those assets in offering documents, and forging and disseminating documents purporting to corroborate those assets, including photoshopped bank and client account statements. The complaint further alleges that Smith and Constantin misled Healthcare Solutions' auditors and falsified certain books and records, and that Constantin violated a penny stock bar previously imposed on him.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charges Smith and Constantin with violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the complaint charges violations of the books-and-records and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act, including: with respect to both Constantin and Smith, violating Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 15(d) and Rules 12b-20, 15d-1, 15d-11, and 15d-13 thereunder; with respect to Smith, violating Rules 13b2-2 and 15d-14; and with respect to Constantin, aiding and abetting violations of Rule 13b2-2. The complaint also charges Constantin with violating Section 15(b)(6)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act by violating the penny stock bar previously imposed on him. The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil money penalties, officer-and-director bars, and conduct-based injunctions, as well as a penny stock bar against Smith.\n\nConstantin, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, has consented to a bifurcated settlement, subject to court approval, that will permanently enjoin him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, impose a conduct-based injunction, and bar him from serving as an officer or director of any SEC-reporting company. Under the terms of the settlement, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Benjamin Mishkin, Eric Kirsch, Frank Milewski, Neil Hendelman, and Wendy Tepperman of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Tejal Shah.

Nutra Pharma Corp. et al No. 2:18-cv-5459 (E.D.N.Y filed Sept. 28, 2018)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Florida Microcap Issuer\n\n\n\nOn August 28, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final consent judgment against microcap issuer Nutra Pharma Corporation, enjoining it from violating certain provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering disgorgement and civil monetary penalties.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Nutra Pharma, a microcap issuer that purports to make pain relief drugs with cobra venom, issued or posted a series of press releases that materially misled investors. The releases allegedly implied, among other things, that Nutra Pharma had engaged a company to distribute its product internationally, when it had not, and that Nutra Pharma had expanded and upgraded its cobra farm facilities, when it did not own those facilities or the cobras, and there were no expansions or upgrades at that time. As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Nutra Pharma publicized many of these press releases while engaged in an unregistered distribution of its securities to retail investors. In addition, Nutra Pharma allegedly failed to make numerous required filings, including ones about the company\u2019s sales of unregistered securities.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged Nutra Pharma with violating Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.\n\nOn August 31, 2022, the court granted the Commission summary judgment on its claims that Nutra Pharma violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-11 thereunder. On March 19, 2024, the Court entered a partial consent judgment against Nutra Pharma in which it agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions.\n\nOn August 28, 2024, the Court entered a final consent judgment against Nutra Pharma in which it was ordered to pay $520,940 in disgorgement and $59,295.05 in prejudgment interest thereon, as well as $100,000 in civil penalties.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by Rusty Feldman, Karolina Klyuchnikova, Lee Greenwood, and Lindsay S. Moilanen of the New York Regional Office and was supervised by Daniel Loss and Sheldon L.

Drew Morgan Ciccarelli, No. 1:20-cv-11789 (D. Mass. filed Sept. 30, 2020)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Defendant in a Microcap Fraud Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced that the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against defendant Drew Ciccarelli on August 21, 2024, in a previously filed action charging him for his role in a pump-and-dump scheme in the stock of Rarus Technologies Inc, a former New York-based microcap company.\n\nThe Commission's complaint, filed in September 2020, alleged that Ciccarelli was paid $150,000 by a shareholder group that secretly controlled Rarus to promote and increase demand for Rarus stock in order for the shareholder group to sell its shares at inflated prices. According to the complaint, Ciccarelli used intermediary entities he controlled to pass funds from the shareholder group to the promoters thereby concealing the shareholder group's sponsorship of the promotional campaign.\n\nCiccarelli, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from violating the securities registration and antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), 17(a)(1), and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and 10b-5(c) thereunder. In addition, Ciccarelli consented to a penny stock bar.\u00a0The final judgment also orders Ciccarelli to pay disgorgement of $35,000 plus prejudgment interest of $13,364.41 that was deemed satisfied by an Order of Forfeiture entered in a parallel criminal action filed by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts. In the parallel criminal proceeding arising from the same conduct, Ciccarelli pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and money laundering and was ordered on June 25, 2024, to incarceration for a term of one year and a day and two years' probation and forfeiture of $500,000.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was led by Marty Healey and J.

Mmobuosi Odogwu Banye (a/k/a Dozy Mmobuosi), Tingo Group, Inc., Agri-Fintech Holdings, Inc. (f/k/a Tingo Inc.), and Tingo International Holdings, Inc., No. 23-civ-10928 (S.D.N.Y. filed Dec. 18, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Default Judgment and More than $250 Million in Monetary Relief Against Tingo Mobile Founder and Three U.S. Companies Charged with Massive Fraud\n\n\n\nOn August 28, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments against Mmobuosi Odogwu Banye a/k/a Dozy Mmobuosi and three affiliated U.S.-based entities of which he was the CEO, in connection with a multi-year scheme to inflate the financial performance metrics of his companies and key operating subsidiaries to defraud investors worldwide.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint[A1]\u00a0, filed on Dec. 18, 2023, alleges, since at least 2019, Mmobuosi spearheaded a scheme to fabricate financial statements and other documents of three entities, Tingo Group Inc., Agri-Fintech Holdings Inc., and Tingo International Holdings Inc. and their Nigerian operating subsidiaries, Tingo Mobile Limited and Tingo Foods PLC. The complaint further alleges that Mmobuosi made and caused the entities to make material misrepresentations about their business operations and financial success in press releases, periodic SEC filings, and other public statements. According to the complaint, Tingo Group\u2019s fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K filed in March 2023 reported a cash and cash equivalent balance of $461.7 million in its subsidiary Tingo Mobile\u2019s Nigerian bank accounts when in reality those same bank accounts had a combined balance of less than $50 as of the end of fiscal year 2022. As alleged in the complaint, Defendants also fabricated the customer relationships that formed the basis of their purported businesses. The complaint also alleges that Mmobuosi and the entities he controlled fraudulently obtained hundreds of millions in money or property through these schemes, and that Mmobuosi siphoned off funds for his personal benefit, including purchases of luxury cars and travel on private jets, as well as an unsuccessful attempt to acquire an English Football Club Premier League team, among other things.\n\nThe judgments, entered on the basis of default, enjoin Mmobuosi, Tingo Group, Agri-Fintech Holdings, and Tingo International Holdings from violating the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgments also enjoin Tingo Group and Agri-Fintech from violating the reporting, books and records, and internal control provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13, and enjoin Mmobuosi from aiding and abetting violations of the same. The judgments also enjoin Mmobuosi from violating the lying to auditors, certification, and falsification of books and records provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2(a), and 13b2-2(b), and periodic filing requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder. The judgment against Mmobuosi includes a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company, a penny stock bar, and a bar from participating in the purchase, sale, offer, or issuance of any security. Tingo International and Mmobuosi are ordered jointly and severally to pay disgorgement of $156,672,705.86 with prejudgment interest of $20,193,871.58, and to disgorge for cancellation all shares of Agri-Fintech stock that Tingo International and Mmobuosi own. Agri-Fintech and Mmobuosi are ordered jointly and severally to pay disgorgement of $12,164,000.00 with prejudgment interest of $574,682.90 and to disgorge for cancellation all shares of Tingo Group stock that Agri-Fintech and Mmobuosi own. Mmobuosi is also ordered to pay disgorgement of $27,632,627.93 with prejudgment interest of $2,032,811.14, to disgorge for cancellation the $204,000,000.00 promissory note inuring to his benefit against Tingo Group, and a civil penalty of $31,908,704.21. Tingo Group, Agri-Fintech, and Tingo International are also ordered to pay a civil penalty of $1,152,314.00 each.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by David Zetlin-Jones and Michael S.

Ala. filed August 26, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges U.S. Navy Shipbuilder Austal USA with Accounting Fraud\n\nAustralian parent company Austal Limited also charged with fraud\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Austal USA, LLC, a Mobile, Alabama-based shipbuilder, and its Australia-based parent company, Austal Limited, have agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges that the companies conducted a fraudulent revenue recognition scheme. As part of the settlement with the SEC, Austal USA will pay a $24 million civil penalty.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from at least January 2013 through July 2016, the Austal companies engaged in a scheme to artificially reduce by tens of millions of dollars the estimated cost to complete certain shipbuilding projects for the U.S. Navy. The complaint alleges that Austal USA knew that its shipbuilding costs were rising and higher than planned, but arbitrarily lowered the cost estimates to meet Austal USA\u2019s revenue budget and projections. The complaint further alleges that based on this fraudulent manipulation of the cost estimates, Austal Limited prematurely recognized revenue and, as a result, met or exceeded analyst consensus estimates for earnings before interest and tax, known as EBIT, a key financial metric for the company.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Austal Limited and Austal USA acted knowingly or with severe recklessness in connection with the scheme that was allegedly carried out by Austal USA\u2019s former president, Craig D. Perciavalle, former director of financial analysis, Joseph A. Runkel, and former director of the Littoral Combat Ships program, William O. Adams, all of whom the SEC charged with accounting fraud in March 2023. That litigation is ongoing.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama, charges Austal Limited and Austal USA with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Austal Limited and Austal USA each consented to permanent injunctions, and Austal USA agreed to pay the aforementioned penalty. The settlements are subject to court approval. The SEC plans to seek the creation of a Fair Fund for distribution of the penalty to harmed investors.\n\nIn a parallel matter, the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section, announced settled charges against Austal USA.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Kimberly Steckling, Kenneth Stalzer, and Donna Walker and supervised by Ian Karpel, Nicholas Heinke, and Mr. Burt of the Denver Regional Office. The ongoing litigation against the individuals is being led by Sharan Lieberman and Christopher Martin and supervised by Gregory Kasper, Mr. Heinke, and Mr. Burt.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

The SEC also charged Abra with operating as an unregistered investment company.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, in or around July 2020, Abra began to offer and sell Abra Earn in the United States. Abra Earn allowed U.S. investors to tender their crypto assets to Abra in exchange for Abra\u2019s promise to pay a variable interest rate. At its height, the Abra Earn program had approximately $600 million in assets, with nearly $500 million from U.S. investors. The complaint alleges that Abra marketed Abra Earn as a means for investors to earn interest on their crypto assets \u201cauto-magically,\u201d and that Abra exercised its discretion to use investors\u2019 crypto assets in various ways to generate income for itself and to fund interest payments. The complaint further alleges that Abra Earn was offered and sold as a security and that the offers and sales did not qualify for an exemption from SEC registration.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint also alleges that Abra operated for at least two years as an unregistered investment company because it issued securities and held more than 40 percent of its total assets, excluding cash, in investment securities, including its loans of crypto assets to institutional borrowers. According to the complaint, in June 2023, Abra began winding down the Abra Earn program and told its U.S.-based Abra Earn customers to withdraw their crypto assets.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charges Abra with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 7(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. To settle the Commission\u2019s charges, Abra, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, has consented to an injunction prohibiting it from violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act and requiring it to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Brittany Frassetto and Kevin Hayne under the supervision of Pei Y. Chung and Stacy L. Bogert. The litigation will be led by Zachary Avallone and supervised by Christopher Bruckmann.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and Enforcement\u2019s Retail Strategy Task Force has previously issued an Investor Bulletin on Crypto Asset Interest-bearing Accounts.

McLean and Joan E. Powell for facilitating a fraudulent scheme to sell purported shares of Eastern Metal Securities (EMS). \u00a0The SEC previously charged Roger Nils-Karlsson in connection with the EMS scheme that victimized thousands of retail investors worldwide. \u00a0\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on March 27, 2023, from on or about November 2012 to June 2019, Karlsson, using various aliases, orchestrated a fraudulent scheme in which he offered and sold EMS shares, purportedly backed by a \u201cPre Funded Reversed Pension Plan\u201d that he claimed to be the world\u2019s first online investment of its kind. \u00a0Karlsson\u2019s scheme was allegedly facilitated by McLean and Powell. \u00a0McLean allegedly offered and sold EMS securities to investors, by making solicitations through podcasts that made materially false and misleading statements. \u00a0As alleged, Powell collected and forwarded investor money to accounts controlled by Karlsson, and McLean and Powell retained a portion of the investment funds for their own personal use despite claiming that they were performing these functions without remuneration.\u00a0\n\nThe final judgments enjoin McLean and Powell from future violations of Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and prohibits them from acting as an officer or director of a public company. \u00a0The final judgments also order McLean to pay disgorgement in the amount of $199,179, plus prejudgment interest of $31,436.48, and a civil penalty of $40,000 and order Powell to pay disgorgement in the amount of $39,815, plus prejudgment interest of $6,284.02, and a civil penalty of $25,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by John C.

FlowPoint Partners, LLC and Peter J. DeCaprio, No. 1:24-cv-12144 (D. Mass. filed Aug. 21, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges Investment Adviser and Principal with Making Misleading Statements to Investors and Breaching Fiduciary Duties to Private Funds\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against FlowPoint Partners, LLC, and its principal, Peter J. DeCaprio, for allegedly making materially misleading statements to investors about an important safeguard for four private funds that they managed and advised (the \u201cFunds\u201d). \u00a0FlowPoint is currently headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and was previously headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. \u00a0The parties have agreed to settle the action by, among other things, paying a total of $290,000 in penalties.\n\nAccording to the complaint, during the period from about July 2020 through late 2023, FlowPoint and DeCaprio misrepresented to investors that the Funds were audited annually by an independent auditor. \u00a0Although they engaged an auditor to audit two of the four Funds, that auditor did not produce any audit reports. \u00a0The complaint alleges that FlowPoint and DeCaprio did not correct their ongoing misstatements to investors despite knowing that the Funds were not actually audited by the auditor they had engaged. \u00a0FlowPoint and DeCaprio also allegedly breached their fiduciary duty to two of the Funds they advised by failing to obtain annual audits for those two Funds, as those Funds\u2019 organizational documents required. \u00a0By failing to operate those Funds as they were required to be operated, Defendants allegedly failed in their duty as investment advisers to those Funds and operated a fraud on the Funds. \u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that FlowPoint and DeCaprio violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. \u00a0The complaint also alleges that FlowPoint violated 204A of the Advisers Act for failing to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures designed to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information, and that DeCaprio aided and abetted that violation.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, FlowPoint and DeCaprio have agreed to settle the Commission\u2019s charges by consenting to the entry of final judgments that: permanently enjoin them from committing future violations of the charged provisions and, as to DeCaprio, from aiding and abetting future violations of Section 204A of the Advisers Act; order FlowPoint and DeCaprio each to pay a $145,000 civil penalty; order FlowPoint to review and correct as necessary all disclosure documents concerning audits of the Funds it advises; and bar DeCaprio from serving as an officer or director of certain public companies for three years. \u00a0The settlements are subject to court approval. \u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case was handled by William J. Durkin, Dahlia Rin, Kathleen Shields, Brandon Sisson, Kerry Vasta, Samantha McGregor, Patrick Noone, and Kevin B. Currid of the Division of Enforcement, with assistance from Andrea Cloutier, Paul D\u2019Amico, Kara Maney, Michael O\u2019Connell, and Raymond Tan of the Division of Examinations, all from the SEC\u2019s Boston Regional Office.\n\u00a0\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

(SAE). The SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that Whiteley, Scott and two other former SAE executives falsely inflated the revenue of SAE by approximately $100 million and concealed their theft of millions of dollars from the company. The SEC\u2019s complaint further alleges that Whiteley separately stole additional company funds through a fictitious invoice scheme.\n\nWithout denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Whiteley consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14(a), 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 3(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. The final judgment also orders Whiteley to pay $7,054,221 in disgorgement plus $1,039,382 in prejudgment interest, for a total of $8,093,603, which shall be deemed satisfied by the restitution order in the Judgment entered against Whiteley in the criminal case of United States v. Whiteley, No. 1:20-cr-534 (S.D.N.Y.). Whiteley was also ordered to reimburse SAE $1,114,303 pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Whiteley previously consented to the aforementioned injunctions and an officer-and-director bar, ordered by the Court on June 29, 2021, and to a suspension from appearing and practicing before the SEC as an attorney or as an accountant, ordered by the Commission on July 6, 2021.\n\nWithout denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Scott consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) and 13b2-1 thereunder; and from aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. The final judgment also orders Scott to pay $219,940 in disgorgement plus $41,763 in prejudgment interest, for a total of $261,703, which shall be deemed satisfied by the restitution order in the Amended Judgment entered against Scott the criminal case of United States v.

Stephen Durland, No. 3:24-cv-02062 (N.D. Tex. filed Aug. 13, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Former New York CPA in Penny-Stock Fraud Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint against North Carolina resident Stephen Durland, formerly a certified public accountant licensed in New York, for his role in an alleged $112 million pump-and-dump scheme orchestrated by Texas resident Philip Verges. The Commission previously filed charges against Verges and others on September 26, 2023, for their roles in the alleged scheme.\n\nThe SEC's complaint against Durland, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, alleges that, from approximately August 2017 through September 2022, Durland prepared financial statements for three companies whose stock price and volume were artificially inflated so that scheme participants could sell their shares for a substantial profit. The SEC alleges that financial statements that Durland prepared for at least one company contained misleading statements, concealing debt-conversion terms that allowed a scheme participant to receive stock at a discount. According to the SEC's complaint, the three companies published disclosure statements on a public website maintained by OTC Markets Group, Inc., falsely stating that the companies' CEOs-not Durland-had prepared the financial statements. The SEC alleges that these false statements served to conceal Durland's significant disciplinary history, including two actions filed by the SEC and a felony securities-fraud conviction.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Durland with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Durland has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these antifraud provisions; imposes a penny-stock bar; orders disgorgement of $83,000 plus prejudgment interest of $16,196.38; and imposes a civil penalty of $230,464. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Derek B. Kleinmann, Christopher Reynolds, and Carol Stumbaugh of the Fort Worth Regional Office, with assistance from Cristy Hart, Robert Nesbitt, Raymond Wolff, and Jason J. Lee. \u00a0The investigation was supervised by Timothy S. McCole and B. David Fraser. \u00a0The litigation will be led by Jason P. Reinsch and supervised by Keefe M.

The SEC had charged Del Prete with insider trading when he purchased shares of HighCape Capital Acquisition Corp. (\u201cHighCape\u201d), a special purpose acquisition company, in advance of the company\u2019s announcement that it would merge with Quantum-Si Incorporated (\u201cQSI\u201d).\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on September 18, 2023, alleged that Del Prete, an accounting consultant to HighCape, was present at HighCape\u2019s board meetings on January 27 and February 17, 2021, at which the planned merger with QSI was discussed. As alleged in the complaint, Del Prete, who had agreed to keep HighCape\u2019s proprietary information confidential, bought shares of HighCape on February 17, 2021, less than an hour after attending the board meeting that day. The complaint further alleged that, within hours of HighCape\u2019s February 18, 2021, press release announcing the deal, Del Prete liquidated his position, realizing an approximate one-hundred percent profit of $60,170 from his illegal trading.\n\nThe final judgment enjoins Del Prete from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, bars him from acting as an officer or director of a publicly traded company, and orders him to pay disgorgement in the amount of $60,170, plus prejudgment interest of $7,012, for a total of $67,182, which shall be deemed satisfied by the forfeiture order entered against Del Prete in the parallel criminal case, United States v. Del Prete, No. 23-cr-745 (ZNQ) (D.N.J. filed Sept. 18, 2023). On April 2, 2024, the court in the criminal case sentenced Del Prete to one year probation, including three months of home detention with location monitoring, and ordered him to pay a $30,000 fine.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Ibrahim Sajalieu Bah and Paul Gizzi of the New York Regional Office and was supervised by Celeste Chase and Thomas P.

NovaTech Ltd., et al., No. 1:24-cv-23058 (S.D. Fla. filed Aug. 12, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges NovaTech and its Principals and Promoters with $650 Million Crypto Fraud\u00a0\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Cynthia and Eddy Petion, along with their company, NovaTech Ltd., for operating a fraudulent scheme that raised more than $650 million in crypto assets from more than 200,000 investors worldwide, including many in the Haitian-American community. The SEC also charged Martin Zizi, Dapilinu Dunbar, James Corbett, Corrie Sampson, John Garofano, and Marsha Hadley for their roles in promoting NovaTech to investors.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, the Petions operated NovaTech as a multi-level marketing (MLM) and crypto asset investment program from 2019 through 2023. They lured investors by claiming NovaTech would invest their funds on crypto asset and foreign exchange markets. Cynthia Petion assured investors that their investments would be safe and promised that \u201c[i]n this program, you are in profit from day one, because again you have access to that capital.\u201d In reality, NovaTech used the majority of investor funds to make payments to existing investors and to pay commissions to promoters, using only a fraction of investor funds for trading. The complaint further alleges that the Petions siphoned millions of dollars of investor assets for themselves. When NovaTech ultimately collapsed, most investors were not able to withdraw their investments, resulting in substantial losses, according to the complaint.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that NovaTech\u2019s top promoters, Zizi, Dunbar, Corbett, Sampson, Garofano, and Hadley, each recruited a wide network of investors and promoters. NovaTech paid them substantial commissions for the investors they and their networks recruited. When Zizi, Dunbar, Corbett, and Sampson became aware of certain red flags about NovaTech, including regulatory actions taken against it by U.S. and Canadian regulators, they continued recruiting investors and downplayed the red flags.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges NovaTech, the Petions, Zizi, Dunbar, Corbett, and Sampson with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and charges NovaTech, the Petions, Dunbar, Corbett, and Sampson with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charges all defendants with violating the securities-registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and charges Zizi, Dunbar, Corbett, Sampson, Garofano, and Hadley with violating the broker-registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Zizi agreed to partially settle the SEC\u2019s charges by consenting to a $100,000 civil penalty and to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged provisions, with the amount of other monetary remedies to be determined at a later date. The partial settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Catherine Rowsey, Todd Baker, and Jamie Haussecker of the Fort Worth Regional Office, with assistance from Sejal Bhakta of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, under the supervision of Nikolay Vydashenko and B. David Fraser.

Targum, Elliot P. Targum, and Nicholas J. Rosenberg, who collectively avoided losses of about $110,000 from trading in advance of the February 13, 2023 announcement of negative clinical drug trial news by biotechnology company Frequency Therapeutics, Inc. \u00a0Each has offered to settle the SEC\u2019s action. \u00a0Among other things, they have agreed to pay a total of over $230,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Steven Targum, who worked as a consultant to Frequency Therapeutics and was subject to a confidentiality agreement with the company, obtained material nonpublic information about the disappointing results of a clinical trial for Frequency Therapeutics\u2019 leading drug product. \u00a0Steven Targum learned this information through emails from senior company officers sent to him on February 4, 2023. \u00a0The complaint alleges that the next business day, February 6, 2023, Steven Targum placed an order to sell all of his Frequency Therapeutics shares, and also placed calls to his son, Elliot Targum, and conveyed material non-public information to Elliot about the negative results of the clinical trial. \u00a0According to the complaint, about six minutes after ending a call with his father, Elliot Targum submitted an order to sell about half of his Frequency Therapeutics shares and called his close friend, Nicholas Rosenberg, and conveyed material non-public information to Nicholas Rosenberg about Frequency Therapeutics. \u00a0As alleged in the complaint, within two hours of ending his call with Elliot Targum, Nicholas Rosenberg submitted an order to sell all of the Frequency Therapeutics shares in one of his brokerage accounts, and sold all of his remaining Frequency Therapeutics shares two days later. \u00a0The SEC alleges that Steven Targum avoided losses of $86,750, Elliot Targum avoided losses of $8,376, and Nicholas Rosenberg avoided losses of about $15,323 when Frequency Therapeutics\u2019 share price dropped 80.6% after the negative study results were made public on February 13, 2023.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, charges Steven Targum, Elliot Targum, and Nicholas Rosenberg with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. \u00a0Without admitting or denying the allegations, Steven Targum, Elliot Targum, and Nicholas Rosenberg consented to judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; ordering Steven Targum to pay disgorgement of $86,750, prejudgment interest of $8,514.20, and a civil penalty of $86,750, and imposing an officer-and-director bar; ordering Elliot Targum to pay disgorgement of $8,376, prejudgment interest of $822.09, and a civil penalty of $8,376, and imposing a five-year officer-and-director bar; and ordering Nicholas Rosenberg to pay disgorgement of $15,323, prejudgment interest of $1,503.90, and a civil penalty of $15,323. \u00a0The judgments are subject to court approval. \u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Dawn Edick, Kathleen Shields, and Amy Gwiazda of the SEC\u2019s Boston Regional Office. \u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. \u00a0\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Richard Xia, et al., No. 21-cv-05350 (E.D.N.Y. filed Sept. 27, 2021)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against New York Real Estate Developer for Perpetrating a $229 Million Fraud Against EB-5 Investors\n\n\n\nOn July 26, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment against Yi\u00a0(Richard) Xia, his company Fleet New York Metropolitan Regional Center, LLC, and his wife JiQing (Julia) Yue.\u00a0 The SEC had charged Xia and Fleet with perpetrating an offering fraud of more than $229 million related to the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program and had named Yue as a relief defendant.\n\nThe SEC alleged in its complaint that, from 2010 through late 2017, Xia, through Fleet, fraudulently raised more than $229 million from more than 450 investors in the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program to develop two large real estate projects in Queens, New York, named Eastern Mirage and Eastern Emerald. Xia and Fleet allegedly made material misrepresentations regarding the existence and sources of financing for the projects, the level of experience of the teams developing and constructing the projects, and the numerous conflicts of interests between Xia, Fleet, and Xia-owned and controlled entities that purportedly acted as developers, general contractors, and subcontractors for the projects and received substantial payments of investor funds. The complaint alleges that Xia controlled and obfuscated the use of investor funds and, among other things, misappropriated approximately $17 million from investors in Eastern Mirage and at least $11.8 million from investors in Eastern Emerald. The SEC subsequently filed an amended complaint naming Xi Verfenstein and Xinming Yu as additional relief defendants.\n\nXia and Fleet, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The final judgment also permanently enjoins Xia and Fleet from participating in the offer or sale of any security, with limited exceptions for Xia. The final judgment also orders Fleet and Xia to pay $228,500,000 in disgorgement plus $25,000,000 in prejudgment interest, for which Fleet and Xia are jointly and severally liable; Xia to pay a civil monetary penalty of $3,101,745; and Fleet to pay a civil monetary penalty of $15,538,635. Under the final judgment, Yue is jointly-and-severally liable for $14,000,000 of the disgorgement amount and $720,000 of the prejudgment interest amount.\n\nFinally, the resolution of the SEC\u2019s claims against Xia, Fleet, and Yue includes the Court\u2019s appointment of a distribution administrator who will, to the extent practicable, assist the defrauded investors in maintaining their immigration status in the EB-5 program.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by David Stoelting, Christopher M. Colorado, and Kim Han and supervised by Preethi Krishnamurthy, Judith Weinstock, and Sheldon L. Pollock, of the New York Regional Office.

As alleged, based on this material, nonpublic information, Baugh then purchased ADT securities and also persuaded another relative to purchase ADT securities. Once ADT\u2019s agreement with Google was made public, Baugh and his relative sold their ADT securities resulting in approximately $397,000 in total profits.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida charges Baugh with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.\u00a0\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Baugh has agreed to consent to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, permanently enjoining him from committing or engaging in specified actions or activities relevant to such violations; ordering him to pay disgorgement of $320,908, plus prejudgment interest thereon of $50,405; and imposing a civil money penalty of $473,660.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was supervised by Sean O\u2019Neill and Glenn Gordon of the Miami Regional Office.

Cal. filed Dec. 17, 2019)\n\nSEC Wins Summary Judgment Against Former Silicon Valley Software Engineer in Multimillion Dollar Insider Trading Ring Case\n\nOn July 25, 2024, Judge Richard Seeborg of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted the SEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Sivannarayana Barama and entered a final judgment against Barama, finding him liable for almost $8.5 million as a result of insider trading.\n\nThe SEC filed its complaint against Barama in December 2019, alleging that he was part of an insider trading ring that made over $7 million. The complaint alleged that Barama and three other defendants received tips from Janardhan Nellore, a former IT administrator at Palo Alto Networks, Inc., regarding the company\u2019s confidential earnings information. Barama and the other defendants then allegedly traded in Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\u2019s securities based on the tips before multiple earnings announcements between 2015 and 2018. Nellore and the three other defendants previously settled their cases with the SEC, with judgments entered by the Court against them. In finding Barama liable, the Court\u2019s order concluded that Barama\u2019s conviction in the related criminal case for securities fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348(2), United States v. Sivannarayana Barama, No. 19-CR-00463-RS (N.D. Cal.), precluded further litigation in the SEC\u2019s action.\n\nThe Court\u2019s final judgment permanently enjoins Barama from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and finds Barama liable for disgorgement of $6,283,079 and prejudgment interest thereon of $2,179,658. The Court ordered that Barama shall satisfy the disgorgement and prejudgment interest obligations by paying $8,462,737 to the SEC within 30 days of any final disposition of the appeal in the related criminal case that does not effect a reversal of the judgment in that action.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by John P.

This practice, in part, enabled Premium Point to engage in a fraudulent valuation scheme that resulted in the inflation of the value of private funds Premium Point advised by hundreds of millions of dollars from at least September 2015 through March 2016, boosting the value of many of Premium Point's holdings and further exaggerating returns in order to conceal poor fund performance and attract and retain investors.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charged Dinucci with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder and Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8(a)(2) thereunder.\n\nThe SEC previously charged Premium Point, along with Premium Point CEO and chief investment officer Anilesh Ahuja, portfolio manager Amin Majidi, and trader Jeremy Shor with fraud on May 9, 2018, later amending its complaint to add Premium Point trader Ashish Dole and Dinucci as defendants. On September 20, 2022, the SEC obtained final judgments on consent enjoining Premium Point and Ahuja from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering Ahuja to pay a civil penalty. The SEC obtained final judgments on consent enjoining Majidi and Dole from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities law on April 11, 2023. On November 7, 2023, the SEC obtained a final judgment on consent enjoining Shor from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.\n\nThe SEC's litigation is led by Assistant Regional Directors Lee Greenwood and Joshua Brodsky and New York Regional Office Co-Regional Trial Counsel Preethi Krishnamurthy.

Robert Newell and Black Hawk Funding, Inc., No. 5:24-cv-01524 (C.D. Cal. filed July 22, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges Fund Manager with $37 Million Offering Fraud and Misappropriation of Investor Money\n\u00a0\n\nOn July 22, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged fund manager Robert Newell and his prior firm, Black Hawk Funding, Inc., with engaging in undisclosed misuses of investor funds, making Ponzi-like payments, and distributing misleading disclosure documents to investors in connection with three cannabis-related private fund offerings. The SEC\u2019s complaint also alleges that Newell misappropriated at least around $668,000 of investor money. Black Hawk Funding agreed to settle the charges against it.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from November 2016 through at least September 2019, Newell and Black Hawk Funding raised approximately $37 million from over 200 investors across the United States for the disclosed purpose of investing in the cannabis industry. However, rather than using the money as disclosed, Newell, through Black Hawk Funding, allegedly made Ponzi-like payments to pay investors their promised ten percent returns and commingled investors\u2019 money through transfers to other entities controlled by Newell to be used as Newell saw fit. Additionally, the SEC alleges that Newell misappropriated investor funds to benefit himself.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, charges Newell and Black Hawk Funding with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d); Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that Newell aided and abetted Black Hawk Funding\u2019s violations. The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief against both Newell and Black Hawk Funding, as well as disgorgement with prejudgment intertest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar against just Newell.\u00a0\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Black Hawk Funding has agreed to consent to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval: (i) providing permanent injunctive relief under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder; and (ii) permanently enjoining Black Hawk Funding from directly or indirectly, including, but not limited to, through any entity owned or controlled by it, participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Kashya Shei and John Roscigno, and supervised by Jeremy Pendrey and Jason H. Lee, all of the SEC\u2019s San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Sheila O\u2019Callaghan and Ms. Shei.\u00a0\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

In the second iteration of his scheme, Engel allegedly promised to use investor funds to purchase a property in Israel that he would then develop and sell. The complaint alleges both claims were false and that rather than use investor money to purchase cameras or develop property, Engel misappropriated the funds by spending investor money for his personal benefit and making Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors in an attempt to keep the scheme going.\n\nEngel consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Engel was ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $5,099,826.00, representing his net profits gained from the conduct alleged in the Complaint, together with prejudgment interest in the amount of $381,731.80. However, the disgorgement figure was deemed satisfied by the restitution order entered in the parallel criminal action United States v. Yossi Engel, Crim. No. CR 23-00213 MEMF (C.D. Cal.), requiring Engel to pay $11,758,030.58.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Daniel Blau and supervised by Douglas M. Miller of the Los Angeles Regional Office.

Action No. 4:22-cv-00194-CDL (M.D. Ga. filed Dec. 7, 2022)\n\n\n\nCourt Enters Final Judgment Against New York Resident Who Conducted $6 Million Fraud Scheme Against Investors in Georgia, California\n\n\n\nOn July 8, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia entered a final judgment against George Iakovou, in an SEC case alleging that he raised approximately $6 million from investors in a fraudulent offering of securities.\n\nThe SEC's\u00a0complaint, filed on December 7, 2022, alleged that Iakovou, and his company, Vika Ventures LLC, offered to sell investors shares of private companies that might hold an initial public offering. However, as set forth in the SEC's complaint, Iakovou and Vika Ventures did not own the shares at the time of the solicitations and never acquired them. Rather than purchasing the securities, Iakovou allegedly used investor funds to support his lavish lifestyle. As CEO of Vika Ventures, Iakovou allegedly used fraudulent documentation and statements to convince investors that Vika Ventures was a successful venture capital firm. According to the SEC's complaint, Penelope Zbravos, Iakovou's then-girlfriend, encountered sufficient red flags regarding the company's operations to make her a negligent participant in Vika Ventures.\n\nThe court also issued a final judgment against Penelope Zbravos, who previously entered into a consent judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act for her negligent actions. The final judgment imposes disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,843,472.09 that has been deemed satisfied by the restitution ordered against her in the parallel criminal case.\n\nThe court previously issued a final judgment against Vika Ventures and imposed a penalty of $8,929,120, among other remedies.\n\nThe SEC's litigation in this matter is now concluded.\n\nIn the parallel criminal case, in August 2023, Iakovou pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. On January 3, 2024, Iakovou was sentenced to 97 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. Iakovou was also ordered to pay restitution of more than $5,958,505. Zbravos was charged with one count of misprision of a felony and entered into pre-trial diversion agreement.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Allison Rochford and Michelle Bougdanos and supervised by David Frohlich and Carolyn Welshhans.

Amah, an investment adviser, who was previously charged with operating a fraudulent investment scheme targeting fellow members of his religion, the Grail Movement.\n\nOn August 9, 2021, the Commission\u00a0charged\u00a0Amah for running a years-long scheme through which he raised approximately $700,000 from his advisory clients using materially false and misleading statements about his investment performance. On September 28, 2023, the Court granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment. In doing so, the Court found Amah liable for fraudulently soliciting investments by \"consistently offer[ing] positive projections while failing to disclose the serious losses he consistently incurred.\"\n\nOn July 2, 2024, the Court entered a final judgment permanently enjoining Amah from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Mich. filed Jan. 4, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Default Judgments Against Two Perpetrators of $45 Million CoinDeal Scheme\n\n\n\nOn June 3, 2024, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan entered final judgments on all claims against Garry Davidson of Henderson, Nevada and Linda Knott of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma for their involvement in an unregistered offering scheme that defrauded tens of thousands of investors.\n\nThe SEC's\u00a0complaint\u00a0alleged that Davidson and Knott falsely claimed that investors could generate extravagant returns by investing in a blockchain technology called CoinDeal that would be sold for trillions of dollars to a group of prominent and wealthy buyers. From at least January 2019 to mid-2022, Davidson and Knott allegedly disseminated false and misleading statements to investors regarding the purported value of CoinDeal, the parties involved in the supposed sale of CoinDeal, and the use of investment proceeds. According to the complaint, no sale of CoinDeal ever occurred and no distributions were made to CoinDeal investors. The complaint further alleged that Davidson, Knott, and their co-defendants collectively misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds for personal use.\n\nDavidson and Knott did not answer or otherwise respond to the SEC's complaint. In an order entering default judgments, the Court found that Davidson and Knott violated the registration and antifraud provisions of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by the alleged orchestrator of the scheme, Neil Chandran. In addition, the Court: (i) permanently enjoined Davidson and Knott from future violations of these provisions; (ii) entered officer-and-director bars against Davidson and Knott; (iii) ordered Davidson to pay disgorgement of $3,911,302 plus prejudgment interest of $915,113 and a $3,911,302 civil penalty; and (iv) ordered Knott to pay disgorgement of $108,171 plus prejudgment interest of $12,714 and a $108,171 civil penalty.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was handled by Michael D.

July 1, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges Silvergate Capital, Former CEO for Misleading Investors about Compliance Program\n\nFormer Chief Risk Officer and former CFO also charged for misleading investors\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission charged Silvergate Capital Corporation, its former CEO Alan Lane, and former Chief Risk Officer (CRO) Kathleen Fraher with misleading investors about the strength of the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) compliance program and the monitoring of crypto customers, including FTX, by Silvergate\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Silvergate Bank. The SEC also charged Silvergate and its former Chief Financial Officer, Antonio Martino, with misleading investors about the company\u2019s losses from expected securities sales following FTX\u2019s collapse. All parties charged, aside from Martino, have agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from November 2022 to January 2023, Silvergate, Lane, and Fraher misled investors in stating that Silvergate had an effective BSA/AML compliance program and conducted ongoing monitoring of its high-risk crypto customers, including FTX, in part to rebut public speculation that FTX had used its accounts at Silvergate to facilitate FTX\u2019s misconduct. In reality, Silvergate\u2019s automated transaction monitoring system failed to monitor more than $1 trillion of transactions by its customers on the bank\u2019s payments platform, the Silvergate Exchange Network.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint also alleges that Silvergate and Martino misrepresented the company\u2019s bleak financial condition during a liquidity crisis and bank run following FTX\u2019s collapse. The complaint alleges that Silvergate and Martino, in an earnings release and earnings call, understated Silvergate\u2019s losses from expected security sales and misrepresented that it remained well-capitalized as of December 31, 2022. In March 2023, Silvergate announced it would wind down its banking operations, and its stock eventually plummeted to near $0.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Silvergate and Lane with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint also charges Silvergate with violating Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, as well as violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and Sections 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. The complaint additionally charges Fraher with violating Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Silvergate agreed to a final judgment ordering it to pay a $50 million civil penalty and imposing a permanent injunction to settle the charges. Lane and Fraher also settled the charges without admitting or denying the allegations, agreeing to permanent injunctions, five-year officer-and-director bars, and to pay civil penalties of $1 million and $250,000, respectively. All the settlements are subject to court approval, and Silvergate\u2019s payment may be offset by penalties paid to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and/or the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI).\n\nThe SEC charged Martino with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder. The SEC\u2019s complaint further charges Martino with aiding and abetting Silvergate\u2019s violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and S Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(b), 12b-20, and 13a-11 thereunder.\n\nIn parallel actions, FRB and DFPI announced settled charges against Silvergate.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Elizabeth Goody, Michael Keating, Amy Mayer, Heidi Mitza, Pasha Salimi, Ivan Snyder, Katherine Stella, and Katherine Zucca, with assistance from Leigh Barrett and Margaret McGuire, and supervised by Mark R. Sylvester, Michael Brennan, and Jorge G. Tenreiro of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. The litigation against Martino will be led by Hayden Brockett, Peter Mancuso, and Laura Meehan, and supervised by Jack Kaufman and Mr. Tenreiro.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Mass. filed November 10, 2022)\n\n\n\nCourt Enters Final Judgment Against Massachusetts Resident Who Conducted $2 Million Ponzi Scheme\n\n\n\nOn June 28, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Adrian J. Kawuba, in an SEC case alleging that he raised approximately $2 million from investors in a fraudulent offering of securities and Ponzi scheme.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed on November 10, 2022, alleged that Kawuba promised investors they would receive returns of 25% to 50% in as little as twelve days to seven months and told investors he would use their money to finance lucrative short-term projects related to youth sports, entertainment events, and private soccer clubs. In fact, as alleged in the complaint, Kawuba used money from later investments to pay out on earlier investments, and he misappropriated investor money to pay for personal travel to the Greek islands and other destinations, to purchase a luxury automobile, and to buy tens of thousands of dollars' worth of designer goods at fashion and jewelry stores.\n\nThe final judgment enjoins Kawuba from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from participating in the offer or sale of any security to investors or potential investors, including but not limited to soliciting or accepting funds from any investor or potential investor in the offer or sale of any securities, provided, however, that the injunction does not prevent Kawuba from purchasing or selling registered securities for his own personal accounts. The final judgment also orders Kawuba to pay disgorgement in the amount of $312,693, plus prejudgment interest of $11,403.44, and offsets these in an amount equal to the forfeiture and/or restitution ordered against Kawuba in the parallel criminal case, United States v. Adrian Kawuba, 23-cr-10012-WGY (D. Mass.)\n\nThe SEC's litigation in this matter is now concluded.\n\nIn the parallel criminal case, on April 11, 2024, Kawuba was sentenced to 27 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. Kawuba was also ordered to pay restitution of more than $625,000, forfeiture of more than $2.2 million, and to pay a special assessment of $400. In December 2023, Kawuba pleaded guilty to four counts of wire fraud.\n\nThe SEC's case was handled by Jonathan Menitove, Kerry Vasta, Sean Fishkind, David London, and Celia Moore of the SEC's Boston Regional Office.\n\n\n\tFinal Judgment\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Frederick L. Sharp et al., No. 1:21-cv-11276 (D. Mass. filed Aug. 5, 2021)\n\nSEC Obtains Judgments Against Participants in International Microcap Fraud Schemes\n\n\nOn June 20, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered judgments against Canadian residents Mike K. Veldhuis, Paul Sexton, Jackson T. Friesen, Zhiying Yvonne Gasarch, and Courtney Kelln for their roles in fraudulent schemes that collectively generated hundreds of millions of dollars from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors in the United States and around the world. Among other relief, these defendants were collectively ordered to pay more than $48 million in disgorgement and civil penalties.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Canadian resident Frederick Sharp masterminded a complex scheme from 2011 to 2019 in which he and his associates\u2014Gasarch and Kelln\u2014enabled control persons of microcap companies, whose stock was publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets, to conceal their control and ownership of huge amounts of the stock and then surreptitiously dump the stock into the U.S. markets, in violation of federal securities laws. The complaint alleged that one group of control persons, comprising Veldhuis, Sexton, and Friesen, frequently collaborated with Sharp to sell massive stock positions while hiding their control positions and stock promotional activities from the investing public. Another defendant, Avtar S. Dhillon, who chaired the boards of directors of four of the public companies whose stocks were fraudulently sold during the schemes, was allegedly complicit with this group of control persons, as well as with Canadian resident Graham R. Taylor. Maryland resident William T. Kaitz worked as a promoter and allegedly touted stocks that Veldhuis, Sexton, and Friesen simultaneously planned to sell, while concealing their roles.\n\nThe court previously entered a judgment by default against Sharp that, among other relief, ordered him to pay more than $50 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, and judgments by consent against Dhillon, Taylor, and Kaitz. Before the trial in this matter, the court entered partial judgments against Kelln and Veldhuis in June 2023 that imposed injunctions and penny stock bars with monetary relief to be determined by the court at a later date. The court then entered a partial judgment against Sexton on September 12, 2023 in which Sexton agreed not to contest his liability, with injunctive and monetary relief to be determined by the court at a later date.\n\nOn September 27, 2023, after a ten-day trial, a jury found Gasarch liable for violating Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, or Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. The jury found Friesen liable for violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) and 13d-1 thereunder, and Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act.\n\nThe judgments against Veldhuis, Sexton, and Friesen permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud, registration, and reporting provisions of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Sections 10(b) and 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 13d-1 thereunder. The judgments further impose penny stock bars and injunctions against participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, but allow for trading on a national securities exchange in their own personal accounts. The judgments also order each of them to pay a civil penalty of $1,562,603. The judgments further hold them jointly and severally liable, along with Sharp, for disgorgement of $42,503,547, with the amount to be disgorged by Veldhuis not to exceed $13,289,897, the amount to be disgorged by Sexton not to exceed $17,367,474, and the amount to be disgorged by Friesen not to exceed $11,846,176. \u00a0\n\nThe judgment against Gasarch permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment further imposes a penny stock bar and an injunction against participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, but allow for trading on a national securities exchange in her own personal account. The judgment also orders her to pay a civil penalty of $269,651 and holds her jointly and severally liable, along with Sharp, for disgorgement of $2,522,367. \u00a0\n\nThe judgment against Kelln permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment further imposes a penny stock bar and an injunction against participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, but allows for trading on a national securities exchange in her own personal account. The judgment also orders her to pay a civil penalty of $904,078 and holds her jointly and severally liable, along with Sharp, for disgorgement of $1,582,785.\n\nThe matter was handled by Kathleen Shields, David London, Alfred Day, Nita Klunder, and Alyssa DiPaolo of the Boston Regional Office.\n\nJudgment \u2013 Veldhuis\n\nJudgment \u2013 Sexton\n\nJudgment \u2013 Friesen\n\nJudgment \u2013 Gasarch\n\nJudgment -- Kelln\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Judgment - Jackson T.

Among other things, the judgments order defendants to pay $425,000 in civil penalties.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on September 19, 2023, alleged that defendants for years engaged in a fraudulent course of conduct that included a loss of control of crypto assets entrusted to them for at least one year without disclosure of that fact to advisory clients, multiple investments with Mr. Lufkin\u2019s spouse\u2019s company without proper disclosure to private fund investors, failure to properly account for withdrawals from the private funds, failure to monitor the value of the investments made by the private funds, and a general derogation of their duty to manage the assets entrusted to them. The complaint also alleged that defendants did not adhere to many of the statutes and rules applicable to registered investment advisers, including rules concerning the custody of assets, the accuracy of reports filed with the SEC, the maintenance of required adviser records, and the production of those records to the SEC Examinations staff.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 206(1), (2), and (4), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. Lufkin Advisors also consented to permanent injunctions against violations of Advisers Act Sections 204(a) and 204A and Rules 204-2(a), 204A-1, 206(4)-2, and 206(4)-7 thereunder, and Mr. Lufkin consented to injunctions against aiding and abetting each of those violations by Lufkin Advisors.

Ross McLellan, Civil Action No. 16-cv-10874 (D. Mass. May 13, 2016)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Former State Street Executive\n\n\n\nOn June 17, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Ross McLellan, a former executive of Massachusetts-based State Street Corporation, for engaging in a scheme to defraud certain customers of State Street\u2019s transition management business.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on May 13, 2016, McLellan led a scheme to add secret commissions to billions of dollars of securities trades performed for at least six clients of State Street\u2019s transition management business, which helps institutional clients move their investments between asset managers or otherwise restructure large investment portfolios. The SEC alleged that the unauthorized commissions were charged in addition to fees the clients had expressly agreed to pay State Street and that McLellan took steps to conceal the commissions from the clients and others within State Street. In a parallel criminal case, McLellan was convicted in October 2018 after a jury trial and later sentenced to a term of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment for his role in the scheme.\n\nOn June 18, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against McLellan. The judgment enjoins McLellan from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case was handled by Eric Heining, Rua Kelly, Rory Alex, and Paul Block of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from Mark Gera of the SEC\u2019s Division of Examinations.

Rosenberger et al., Civil Action No. 1:22-cv-4736 (DLC) (S.D.N.Y. filed June 7, 2022)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Synchronoss CFO for Role in Accounting Misconduct\n\n\n\nOn June 14, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Karen Rosenberger, imposing an injunction and officer and director bar, and also ordering her to pay civil monetary penalties and reimburse Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. (\u201cSynchronoss\u201d) for certain compensation.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Rosenberger engaged in accounting misconduct which resulted in the overstatement of revenue by Synchronoss. The SEC alleged that Rosenberger aided and abetted Synchronoss\u2019s public filing of materially false financial statements with respect to five transactions. Synchronoss later restated and allegedly engaged in fraud with respect to three of them\u2014two transactions with one of Synchronoss\u2019s largest customers and one transaction in which Synchronoss acquired another business. The SEC further alleged that Rosenberger sought to cover up her and Synchronoss\u2019s misconduct by lying to Synchronoss\u2019s auditor in connection with those transactions, falsifying books and records, and by failing to implement or maintain, and circumventing, Synchronoss\u2019s system of accounting controls. The Complaint alleged that the impact of the improper accounting was material, and in certain instances, allowed Synchronoss to meet revenue expectations it otherwise would not have met.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged Rosenberger with violating Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder; violating Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d); and aiding and abetting Synchronoss\u2019s violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. On January 26, 2024, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment against Rosenberger finding that Rosenberger violated numerous provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Rosenberger consented to a final judgment in which she agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions, barred from serving as an officer and director, agreed to pay $125,000 in civil monetary penalties, and agreed to reimburse Synchronoss over $430,000 in compensation pursuant to SOX 304. On June 14, 2024, the Court entered the final judgment.\n\nThe litigation is being led by Hayden Brockett, Theresa Gue, Lindsay S. Moilanen, and Richard G. Primoff under the supervision of Sheldon L.

The SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that, through his work at Lumentum, Bhardwaj learned material nonpublic information (\u201cMNPI\u201d) about Lumentum\u2019s plans to first acquire Coherent, Inc. and later to acquire NeoPhotonics Corporation. Based on this MNPI, Bhardwaj allegedly purchased Coherent securities ahead of the January 2021 announcement of Lumentum\u2019s agreement to acquire Coherent. The SEC further alleged that, in October 2021, Bhardwaj shared MNPI about Lumentum\u2019s planned acquisition of NeoPhotonics with his friends Kakkera and Saeedi, who then bought NeoPhotonics securities based on Bhardwaj\u2019s tips.\u00a0\n\nThe case originated from the SEC Enforcement Division\u2019s Market Abuse Unit Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious trading patterns.\n\nBhardwaj, Kakkera, and Saeedi, each of whom has pleaded guilty in the parallel criminal action United States v. Bhardwaj, et al., 22 Cr. 398 (GHW), consented to entry of the final judgments in the SEC action permanently enjoining them from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and barring them from serving as officers or directors of public companies, Bhardwaj and Saeedi permanently, and Kakkera for a period of seven-and-a-half years. The final judgments also order Bhardwaj, Kakkera, and Saeedi to disgorge the illicit gains that they made in their own accounts and in other accounts that they controlled \u2013 $462,598.91 for Bhardwaj, $2,453,687.99 for Kakkera, and $691,104.73 for Saeedi \u2013 with prejudgment interest thereon, the payment of which was deemed satisfied by the forfeiture orders entered in the parallel criminal action.\n\nIn light of the disgorgement orders against Bhardwaj, Kakkera, and Saeedi, the SEC voluntarily dismissed its claims for unjust enrichment against relief defendants Gauri Salwan, The Kakkera Family Trust, All US Tacos Inc., and Janya Saeedi.\n\nThe litigation is being led by Joshua R.

Bentley of Tomball, Texas.\n\nAs alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint filed on August 16, 2022, from February 2019 until April 2021, Bentley orchestrated a multimillion-dollar fraud and misappropriated investor funds through his control of Bellatorum, which acted as an investment adviser for three private investment funds. Through his control of Bellatorum, Bentley raised approximately $31.5 million from approximately 149 investors.\n\nOn August 22, 2022, the court entered a partial judgment against Defendants, permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and imposing an officer-and-director bar. The partial judgment deferred the determination of the amounts of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to a future date. Thereafter, without denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that ordered Defendants to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $13,131,470 plus prejudgment interest of $963,727.07, for a total of $14,095,197.07, and deemed the payment of such amounts satisfied by the judgment in United States v. Christopher Russell Bentley, Crim. No. 4:22-cr-400 (S.D. Tex. [Houston]). The final judgment, which the Court entered on May 30, 2024, did not include a civil penalty in light of the term of imprisonment against Bentley in the parallel criminal case.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Christopher W.

Giguiere allegedly caused the first issuer, a purported technology company focused on the cannabis industry, to improperly issue stock to his nominee entity, and then liquidated that stock while concurrently promoting it, earning several million dollars in illicit proceeds. According to the complaint, Giguiere also used his undisclosed control of the second issuer, a purported medical device company, to profit by conducting a matched trading scheme in the stock with a Cayman Islands-based broker and a third individual who, unbeknownst to Giguiere and the broker, was an FBI cooperating witness. Giguiere allegedly grossed over $1.5 million in proceeds as a result of this second scheme, and was taking steps to continue it, when the SEC suspended trading in the stock.\u00a0 \n\nThe complaint charged Giguiere with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. Giguiere, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to a bifurcated settlement, agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions and to an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar. The Court entered the bifurcated consent judgment on April 17, 2023. The SEC made a motion for $7,760,415.97 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon of $2,091,439.85 and civil penalties of $875,000, which the Court granted on June 11, 2024.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation is being led by Christopher J.

Qsar tipped Lambert and others who then used the information to purchase Del Taco call options. The complaint further alleged that Lambert made about $25,100.00 in illegal trading profits and tipped his cousin who also bought Del Taco call options.\n\nThe case originated from the SEC\u2019s Market Abuse Unit\u2019s Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious trading patterns.\n\nLambert consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Lambert was ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $25,080.00, representing his net profits gained from the conduct alleged in the Complaint, together with prejudgment interest in the amount of $3,473.96. Lambert was also ordered to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $29,775.00.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Charles Canter and supervised by Douglas M.

Cal. filed Mar. 26, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Former Arista Networks Chairman Andy Bechtolsheim for Insider Trading\n\n\n\nOn May 30, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered a final judgment, by consent, against Andreas \"Andy\" Bechtolsheim, the founder and Chief Architect of Silicon Valley-based technology company Arista Networks, Inc., in an action alleging that Bechtolsheim engaged in insider trading.\n\nThe SEC alleged in its complaint, filed on March 26, 2024, that Bechtolsheim, who was Arista Networks's chair at the time, illegally traded in Acacia options on July 8, 2019, after learning of Acacia's impending acquisition through his and Arista Networks's longstanding relationship with another multinational technology company that was also considering acquiring Acacia. Immediately after learning this information, Bechtolsheim allegedly traded Acacia options in the accounts of a close relative and an associate. The next day, July 9, 2019, before the market opened, Acacia and Cisco announced that Cisco had agreed to acquire Acacia. According to the SEC's complaint, Bechtolsheim's trading generated combined illegal profits of $415,726 in the accounts of his relative and associate.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Bechtolsheim consented to the entry of the judgment which enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $923,740.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by John P. Mogg of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit in the San Francisco Regional Office with assistance from Patrick McCluskey, John S.

Tex. filed Feb. 22, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Houston Resident Charged with Insider Trading Based on Information Misappropriated from His Wife\n\n\n\nOn May 28, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered a final judgment against Tyler Loudon of Houston, Texas.\n\nAs alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint filed on February 22, 2024, Loudon misappropriated material, nonpublic information regarding the proposed acquisition of TravelCenters of America Inc. by BP p.l.c. from his then wife, who was a BP employee working on the deal. Between December 22, 2022 and February 6, 2023, Loudon purchased approximately 46,000 shares of Travel Centers stock. After the acquisition was announced on February 16, 2023, Loudon realized an illicit profit of $1,760,000.\n\nOn March 7, 2024, the court entered a partial judgment against Loudon permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and imposing an officer and director bar. The partial judgment deferred the determination of the amounts of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to a future date. Thereafter, without denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Loudon consented to entry of the final judgment that ordered him to pay disgorgement of $1,760,000 plus prejudgment interest of $85,600.06, for a total of $1,845,600.06 and deemed Loudon\u2019s obligation to pay the disgorgement and prejudgment interest satisfied by the order of forfeitureof $1,763,522 ordered in United States v. Tyler Loudon, No. 4:24-cr-57 (S.D. Tex.). The final judgment, which the Court entered on May 28, 2024, did not include a civil penalty in light of the term of imprisonment ordered against Loudon in the parallel criminal case.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Julia Huseman and Jamie Haussecker of the SEC\u2019s Fort Worth Regional Office, under the supervision of Jim Etri and B.

N.C. filed May 30, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges North Carolina Man and His Advisory Firm With Running Ponzi Scheme Victimizing More Than 100 Clients\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Charlotte, North Carolina resident Frank Lynold Mercado and the unregistered advisory firm that he controlled, Tiger Wolf Capital, LLC, with defrauding more than 100 investors through a Ponzi scheme.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, between August 2019 and February 2023, Mercado and Tiger Wolf made unregistered offerings of securities, raising more than $1.4 million from over 100 individual investors and advisory clients. The complaint alleges that Tiger Wolf and Mercado falsely claimed, among other things, that clients were receiving a \u201c50%+\u201d return on investment and touted an \u201c[u]ncompromising focus on risk management.\u201d In reality, Mercado, who had no prior experience in the securities industry, and Tiger Wolf did not invest the majority of client funds in Tiger Wolf\u2019s offerings and instead used money from new investors to make payments to existing investors. The SEC also alleges that Mercado spent investor funds on personal expenses and created fake account statements to create the illusion of profits.\n\nThe complaint, filed May 30, 2024, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, charges Mercado and Tiger Wolf with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.\u00a0\n\nWithout denying the allegations, Mercado and Tiger Wolf each consented to the entry of an order, subject to court approval, permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions and agreed to pay a to-be-determined amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. Mercado also consented to a permanent bar from serving as officer or director of a public company and an injunction that permanently bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of securities, except in his personal account.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Brian M. Basinger and Richard V. Rodriguez of the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by Stephen E. Donahue and Justin C. Jeffries. The litigation will be led by Edward G.

May 21, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains $5.9 Million Judgment Against Unregistered Penny Stock Dealer\n\n\n\nOn May 21, 2024, Judge Georgette Castner of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against John D. Fierro and JDF Capital, Inc. The SEC's complaint alleged that the Defendants failed to register as securities dealers with the SEC, or to associate with a registered dealer, when they bought and sold billions of newly issued shares of penny stock from at least January 2015 through November 2017. The Defendants obtained the shares directly from issuers after converting debt securities known as convertible notes. By failing to register, Defendants avoided certain regulatory obligations\u00a0for dealers\u00a0that govern their conduct in the marketplace, including regulatory inspections and oversight, financial responsibility requirements, and maintaining books and records.\n\nThe court previously granted summary judgment to the Commission. On June 29, 2023, the court found that Fierro and JDF Capital engaged in a regular business of buying and selling securities for their own account, and that their failure to register as dealers violated the dealer registration requirements of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIn its final judgment, the court ordered Fierro and JDF Capital to pay on a joint-and-several basis disgorgement of $4,053,148, prejudgment interest of $1,326,440, and a civil penalty of $500,000, for a total judgment of $5,879,588. The court also entered a permanent injunction against Defendants and ordered them to surrender for cancellation certain stock and conversion rights under existing convertible securities.\n\nThe SEC is represented by Joshua E.

Ganesh H. Betanabhatla, No. 8:24-cv-00184 (D. Neb. filed May 22, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges Former Fund Manager with Defrauding Two SPACs and a Private Issuer\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Ganesh H. Betanabhatla, who previously managed private equity funds through his now-defunct Houston-based firm, Ramas Capital Management, LLC, has agreed to settle charges that he defrauded three issuers by committing to purchase $263.5\u00a0million of their securities on behalf of investment funds he managed when he and the funds did not have the money to invest.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United Stated District Court for the District of Nebraska, Betanabhatla hid the fact that the funds he claimed to manage had no money to invest by falsifying key documents and emails that he provided to the issuers, and lying to one issuer about having $500 million to invest. The SEC alleges that none of the $263.5 million in commitments that Betanabhatla made was funded, leaving the issuers to fill the gap in capital they thought they had secured. As alleged, two of the issuers that Betanabhatla defrauded were special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, and the third was a private company.\n\nBetanabhatla, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, that would permanently enjoin him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, order him to pay a $250,000 civil penalty, and impose a five-year officer-and-director bar on him.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Robert J.

Pedram Abraham Mehrian, Strategic Legacy Investment Group, Inc., and SLIG High-Interest Liquid Savings Company, No. 2:23-cv-08009 (C.D. Cal. filed Sept. 25, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgments Against Strategic Legacy Investment Group, Inc. and SLIG High-Interest Liquid Savings Company in Connection with a Ponzi-Like Scheme\n\n\n\nOn April 18, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained final judgments against Strategic Legacy Investment Group, Inc. (\u201cSLIG\u201d) and SLIG High-Interest Liquid Savings Company (\u201cSLIG High\u201d), two entities the SEC charged with an alleged Ponzi-like scheme and misleading investors who had purchased more than $17.5 million in promissory notes.\n\nThe amended complaint alleged that SLIG and SLIG High raised money from retail investors for the purported purpose of investing in real estate. SLIG and SLIG High raised this money through the unregistered offer and sale of promissory notes, which they represented paid \u201cguaranteed interest\u201d above market interest rates offered by banks, often as high as 9%. According to the complaint, SLIG and SLIG High represented to investors the notes were \u201csafe\u201d and \u201csecure\u201d because they were backed and collateralized by SLIG\u2019s portfolio of assets and were recession-proof. The complaint further alleged SLIG and SLIG High treated investor funds as one pool of money, commingled investor funds, and diverted new investor funds to make Ponzi-like payments to existing investors totaling at least $4.2 million. They are also alleged to have made materially false and misleading statements to investors by failing to disclose that they were not profitable, as their assets did not generate enough revenue to pay promised returns, and investors did not have any collateralized interest in real estate. When SLIG was unable to pay promised returns, it blamed the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for its failure to pay, but continued to send investors false account statements showing ever-growing account balances from interest payments that were never made.\n\nThe Court entered a final judgments permanently enjoining SLIG and SLIG High from violating: (1) the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; (2) section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and (3) sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. SLIG was ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $4,897,210.08, representing net profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $487,378.56. SLIG was also ordered to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,152,314. SLIG High was ordered to pay disgorgement in the amount of $647,767.49, representing net profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint, together with prejudgment interests thereon in the amount of 64,466.90. SLIG High was also ordered to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,152,314.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Daniel Lim and supervised by Douglas M. Miller.

Nutra Pharma Corp. et al, No. 2:18-cv-5459 (E.D.N.Y filed Sept. 28, 2018)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgments Against Florida Microcap CEO and Consultant for Fraud\n\n\n\nOn May 13, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered final consent judgments against Erik (\u201cRik\u201d) Deitsch, the former CEO of microcap issuer Nutra Pharma Corporation (\u201cNutra Pharma\u201d), and Sean McManus, a consultant for Nutra Pharma, enjoining them from violating certain provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement and civil monetary penalties, imposing penny stock bars, and as to Deitsch, imposing an officer-and-director bar.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Nutra Pharma, a microcap issuer that purports to make pain relief drugs with cobra venom, and Deitsch, issued or posted a series of press releases that materially misled investors. The releases allegedly implied, among other things, that Nutra Pharma had engaged a company to distribute its product internationally, when it had not, and that Nutra Pharma had expanded and upgraded its cobra farm facilities, when it did not own those facilities or the cobras and there were no expansions or upgrades at that time. Nutra Pharma publicized many of these press releases while Nutra Pharma and Deitsch allegedly engaged in an unregistered distribution of its securities to retail investors. In addition, on multiple occasions, Deitsch allegedly engaged in manipulative trading to stabilize or raise Nutra Pharma\u2019s stock price and create the appearance of active trading. Further, Nutra Pharma and Deitsch allegedly failed to make numerous required filings, including ones about the company\u2019s sales of unregistered securities and ones about Deitsch\u2019s beneficial ownership of the company\u2019s securities. McManus allegedly made misrepresentations to investors while acting as an unregistered broker.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged Deitsch with violating Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and Sections 9(a)(2), 10(b), 13(a), 13(d), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13d-2, and 16a-3 thereunder. The Commission further alleged he aided and abetted Nutra Pharma\u2019s violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10(b)-5, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. McManus was charged with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n\nOn August 31, 2022, the court granted the Commission summary judgment on its claims that Deitsch violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-2 and 16a-3 thereunder. The Commission dismissed the aiding and abetting charges against Deitsch, and on March 19, 2024, the Court entered partial consent judgments against Deitsch and McManus in which they agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions. As to Deitsch, the consent judgment also included a three-year officer and director bar and a three-year penny stock bar.\n\nOn May 13, 2024, the Court entered final consent judgments against Deitsch and McManus. Deitsch was ordered to pay $44,046.28 in disgorgement and $5,013.49 in prejudgment interest thereon, as well as $30,000 in civil penalties. McManus was ordered to pay $5,500 in disgorgement and $625.03 in prejudgment interest thereon, as well as $5,500 in civil penalties and agreed to a two-year penny stock bar.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation is being handled by Lindsay S.

(\"ForceField Energy\"). The SEC alleged that Mitchell and others engaged in schemes using cash bribes and other kickbacks to registered representatives and unregistered brokers who solicited investors to buy stock in ForceField Energy. The SEC further alleged that investors were unaware those soliciting them were being paid to steer them to the stock. Mitchell, a purported investor relations professional, was hired to pay kickbacks to certain registered representatives in return for their recommending and purchasing ForceField Energy stock in their customers' accounts.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charged Mitchell with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

On May 10, 2024, the Court entered a final judgment against Mitchell by consent in which he further agreed to disgorge $82,220 in ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest thereon, the payment of which was deemed satisfied by the restitution order in the parallel criminal proceeding, United States v.

Beck and his mother, Helen P. Robinson, in Connection with a Penny Stock Fraud \n\n\nOn April 17, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained final judgments against Michael M. Beck, who the SEC charged with an alleged penny stock fraud, and his mother, relief defendant Helen Robinson.\n\nThe complaint alleged that Beck engaged in fraud with respect to eight different penny stocks - recommending the purchase of the stock without disclosing his intent to sell the stock, and then selling it at inflated prices to generate profits. Beck repeatedly purchased blocks of penny stock shares and then tweeted that he would soon be issuing a new stock recommendation to his millions of followers and the public at large. According to the complaint, Beck\u2019s tweets encouraged readers to join \"TeamBillionaire\" so they could receive the recommendation by email. The complaint further alleged that, a few days before Beck publicly tweeted a recommendation, he typically emailed it to TeamBillionaire members or had third parties post favorable commentary about the stock on investor message boards. Beck then typically began to sell his shares, and shares owned by his mother, relief defendant Helen Robinson, before tweeting the recommendation publicly and typically sold additional shares after tweeting positively about the stock. The complaint alleged that Beck failed to disclose his plans to sell, or his ongoing selling, of shares in any of the tweets, emails, or message board posts.\u00a0\n\nThe Court entered a final judgment permanently enjoining Beck from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Beck was also barred for five years, following the date of entry of the Final Judgment, from participating in an offering of penny stocks, including engaging in activities with a broker, dealer, or issuer for purposes of issuing, trading, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock. Beck was also ordered to pay, on a joint-and-several basis with relief defendant Helen Robinson, disgorgement of $572,270.00, with prejudgment interest in the amount of $112,062.32. Beck was also ordered to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $230,464.00.\u00a0 Robinson was ordered to pay, on a joint-and-several basis with Beck, disgorgement in the amount of $386,732.00, with prejudgment interest in the amount of $75,730.14.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was led by Ruth C. Pinkel and Daniel Lim and supervised by Douglas M. Miller. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Roberto Tercero and supervised by Marc Blau of the Los Angeles Regional Office.

The judgment resolves the SEC\u2019s charges against defendants for their roles in a scheme to defraud retirement account holders out of more than $50 million in connection with defendants\u2019 sales of gold and silver coins between 2017 and 2022.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint (filed on May 15, 2023, and amended on August 11, 2023), since at least 2017, the defendants repeatedly solicited investors through false and misleading statements, telling them to \u201cprotect\u201d their retirement savings by selling securities held in their retirement accounts\u2014including federal employee Thrift Savings Plan accounts, 401(k) plans, and Individual Retirement Accounts\u2014to invest in gold or silver coins at only a 1 to 5 percent markup. The complaint alleges that in reality, Red Rock charged as much as 130 percent in markups on the precious metal coins they sold to investors. Through this scheme, defendants allegedly defrauded at least 700 investors out of more than $50 million.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, defendants consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; ordering Red Rock to pay disgorgement in the amount of $50,150,000, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $6,110,000, and $10,000,000 in civil penalties; ordering Kelly to pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,841,727.89, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $224,241.37, and $1,500,000 in civil penalties and prohibiting Kelly from serving as an officer or director of a public company; ordering Spencer to pay disgorgement in the amount of $2,156,905.15, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $262,616.15, and $580,478.70 in civil penalties; and ordering Ward to pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,224,215.28, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $149,055.46, and $200,464 in civil penalties.\u00a0\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and California and Hawaii state regulators,\u00a0the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation and the Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs also obtained a final judgment in their parallel action, CFTC et al. v. Red Rock Secured LLC, Shade Johnson-Kelly a/k/a Sean Kelly, and Anthony Spencer, No. 2:23-CV-03680-RGK-PVC (C.D. Cal. filed May 15, 2023). The amounts owed by Red Rock, Kelly, and Spencer to the SEC will be offset by any payments they make to the CFTC in connection with its final judgment.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Michael Ellis and Elzbieta Wraga of the SEC\u2019s New York Regional Office and was supervised by Hane L.

Mark Korb, No. 2:22-cv-04031-CAS-AS (C.D.

(\u201cPetroteq\u201d), executive chairman Aleksandr Blyumkin and chief financial officer Mark Korb.\u00a0 On June 13, 2022, the SEC filed partially settled cease-and-desist proceedings against Blyumkin and Petroteq, and a litigated civil action against Korb.\u00a0\n\nIn the administrative proceedings, the SEC issued an order on June 13, 2022 finding that, from September 2017 to May 2019, Petroteq raised $7.39 million through an unregistered offering of stock.\u00a0 Petroteq filed with the SEC Form D notices signed by Blyumkin that represented that Petroteq would not pay commissions in connection with the offering and that its officers or directors would not receive offering proceeds.\u00a0 The SEC\u2019s order found, however, that Petroteq paid $2.89 million in commissions, and that Blyumkin personally received $68,623 of the offering proceeds.\u00a0 The June 13, 2022 order required Blyumkin to pay a civil penalty of $450,000, imposed a cease-and-desist order, barred him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and ordered further proceedings to determine what disgorgement and prejudgment interest should be ordered against him. On April 12, 2024, the SEC issued an order against Blyumkin by consent, ordering him to pay disgorgement of $1,791,508 plus prejudgment interest of $210,201.26.\u00a0\n\nIn the civil action against Korb, the SEC\u2019s complaint alleged, among other things, that Korb failed to consider whether Petroteq\u2019s mining rights were appropriately priced and analyzed for impairment, and was at least negligent in not inquiring into or disclosing multiple transactions benefiting Blyumkin, his family, and his associates.\u00a0 On April 10, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment by agreement against Korb, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $60,000 and permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rules 13a-14 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13a-15(a) thereunder.\u00a0\n\nFinally, on April 22, 2024, the SEC issued an order against Korb by consent pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice.\u00a0 The SEC\u2019s order suspended Korb from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant with a right to apply for reinstatement after two years.\n\nThe cases were litigated by Jason P.

Levin.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint filed on May 9, 2023, Levin solicited investors to purchase approximately $2.6 million worth of units in a fund he controlled, the CRP Fund, which in turn owned units in funds run by GPB Capital. Levin allegedly violated the requirements of the broker-dealer registration provisions by soliciting those funds from at least 27 investors from 2017 through 2018, without being registered with the SEC as a broker, as he was required to do.\n\nThe complaint, filed in the Northern District of Texas, charged Levin with violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Levin, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to a bifurcated settlement, agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provision. The Court entered the bifurcated judgment on July 26, 2023.

Jack B. Blount, No. 4:24-cv-375 (E.D. Tex. filed April 30, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Former CEO of Dallas Area Cybersecurity Company with Fraud\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint against Jack B. Blount, the former CEO of Intrusion Inc. (\"Intrusion\"), for making false and misleading statements in 2020 and 2021 regarding the company's purported success in marketing a cybersecurity product, the terms of multiple contracts, and Blount's background and experience. Blount has agreed to settle the SEC's charges. The settlement with Blount follows the SEC's settled action against Intrusion in September 2023.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that from May 2020 through May 2021, Blount made or approved materially false and misleading statements in press releases, earnings calls, interviews, and other public statements. As alleged in the complaint, Blount overstated the company's success in marketing Intrusion Shield, a cybersecurity product, by falsely representing that most or nearly all beta-testing participants had converted to paying customers, when in fact less than half of such participants became paying customers. In addition, the SEC alleges that Blount and Intrusion misled investors about three customer relationships by omitting material information about the economic terms of one contract, prematurely claiming that a second contract had been executed, and falsely claiming that a third customer had signed a contract when it had not. Finally, the complaint alleges that Blount made misleading statements about his qualifications, experience, and accomplishments.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, charges Blount with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Blount has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and imposes an officer and director bar against Blount. The final judgment does not impose a civil penalty based on Blount's inability to pay. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted and supervised by staff of the Fort Worth Regional Office, including Melvin Warren, Nikolay V. Vydashenko, B. David Fraser, and Eric R. Werner. The litigation is being conducted by Jason Rose and supervised by Keefe Bernstein.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Sanjay Bhandari et\u00a0 al., No. 1:24-cv-00710 (E.D.\u00a0Va.\u00a0filed Apr. 30, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Virginia Resident and Two Friends with Insider Trading\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filed insider trading charges today against Sanjay Bhandari, Vinod Singhi, and Rakesh Jain, who collectively made about $70,000 in profits from trading in advance of the January 19, 2022 announcement that Zogenix Inc. would be acquired by another company. They each offered to settle the SEC's action, including by agreeing to pay disgorgement, interest, and penalties totaling over $170,000.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, Virginia resident Bhandari learned of the acquisition on January 18, 2022, the day before the first public announcement of the acquisition, during a phone conversation with an individual who worked at Zogenix. As alleged in the complaint, the individual had a close personal relationship with Bhandari and told Bhandari about the acquisition in the context of seeking career advice. The complaint alleges that Bhandari began buying Zogenix stock while still on the phone with the individual at Zogenix, and then provided the material, nonpublic acquisition news to his friend and New York resident Singhi, who in turn provided it to their mutual friend and California resident Jain. As alleged, Singhi and Jain each then purchased Zogenix stock before the public announcement, and Bhandari, Singhi, and Jain then sold all of their stock before noon on January 19, 2022, after the acquisition announcement was made public and the price of Zogenix stock had increased over 60% in value. The SEC alleges that Bhandari made about $49,000 on his Zogenix trades, Singhi made about $10,500, and Jain made about $9,500.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, charges Bhandari, Singhi, and Jain with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Bhandari, Singhi, and Jain consented to judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section\u00a010(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; ordering Bhandari to pay disgorgement of $49,015, prejudgment interest of $7,020, and a civil penalty of $73,523; ordering Singhi to pay disgorgement of $10,555, prejudgment interest of $1,512, and a civil penalty of $10,555; and ordering Jain to pay disgorgement of $9,570, prejudgment interest of $1,371, and a civil penalty of $9,570. The judgments are subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Jonathan Allen, Magdalena Ellis, David D'Addio, and Amy Gwiazda of the SEC's Boston Regional Office.

Sumichrast, No. 3:22-cv-00246 (W.D.N.C. filed May 31, 2022)\n\n\n\nOn April\u00a029, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina entered final judgment against North Carolina resident Martin A. Sumichrast.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint in this litigation alleged that Sumichrast became the sole manager of Stone Street Partners, LLC, a private fund, following the death of the fund's co-manager in December 2016.\u00a0 Beginning in 2017, the complaint alleges, Sumichrast caused Stone Street to enter into various transactions with himself and a publicly-traded company of which he was the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors (\u201cthe Company\u201d).\u00a0 These transactions included:\u00a0 (a) Sumichrast doubling his salary from Stone Street, from $100,000 to $200,000, in each of 2017, 2018 and 2019; (b) Stone Street purchasing restricted shares of the Company from Sumichrast; (c) Stone Street purchasing shares of a privately-held vaping company from Sumichrast; and (d) Stone Street purchasing from the Company shares in a microcap company shortly before the Company\u2019s initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d).\u00a0 According to the complaint, the microcap company was heavily in debt and at risk of failing at the time Stone Street acquired the shares, and Sumichrast arranged this transaction to remove those shares from the Company\u2019s financial statements, thereby improving the Company\u2019s chances for a successful IPO.\n\nThe SEC alleged that each of these transactions presented conflicts of interest and, according to the complaint, Sumichrast failed to disclose them in advance to Stone Street or obtain the consent from a majority of Stone Street\u2019s investors for these transactions.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Sumichrast consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 206(2) and (3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $225,000, prejudgment interest of $50,000, and a civil penalty of $75,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case was handled by M. Graham Loomis, Pat Huddleston, Robert K. Gordon, and Mark Eric Harrison of the Atlanta Regional Office.\n\nFinal Judgment\u00a0\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Rivero, a former registered representative at a broker-dealer, who misappropriated more than $480,000 from his advisory clients and brokerage customers.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on March 14, 2022, between at least July 2018 and November 2020, Rivero, then a registered representative, fraudulently misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars from investment accounts that he handled, including accounts owned by elderly and/or disabled investors. The SEC alleged that Rivero convinced at least five of his clients to transfer funds from their investment accounts to their bank accounts and then from their bank accounts to entities with which Rivero was secretly associated with. Rivero allegedly lied to his victims, explaining the purpose of the fund transfers was so that he could make various investments on their behalf including, in some instances, investments in the stock market. The complaint further alleged that Rivero took investor funds for his own benefit, and he never disclosed to his clients that he would personally benefit from the fund transfers.\n\nRivero was charged with violating Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. On March 6, 2023, the Court entered a partial judgment against Rivero by consent in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions. On April 26, 2024, the Court entered a final judgment against Rivero by consent in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions. He also agreed to pay disgorgement of $488,978, the payment of which was deemed satisfied by the restitution order in the parallel criminal proceeding, United States v. Mario E. Rivero, Jr., Crim. No. 23-cr-88 (D.N.J.).\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was handled by Christopher J. Dunnigan, John C. Lehmann, and Lindsay S. Moilanen of the New York Regional Office and was supervised by Thomas P.

Kevin Crotty, No. 1:24-cv-3387 (N.D. Ill. Filed April 26, 2024)\u00a0 \n\nSEC Charges Former BP Senior Manager with Insider Trading \n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Chicago-area resident Kevin Crotty with insider trading ahead of a February 16, 2023 announcement that BP p.l.c. agreed to acquire TravelCenters of America Inc.\u00a0 This is the second insider trading case the SEC has brought in connection with trading ahead of the announcement of BP\u2019s acquisition of TravelCenters.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Crotty misappropriated material, nonpublic information from a BP colleague who was working on the acquisition.\u00a0 The SEC alleges that after learning that it was highly likely that the deal would close, Crotty purchased 848.824 shares of TravelCenters stock on February 15, 2023.\u00a0 The following day, TravelCenters announced the acquisition, which triggered a 70.8% increase in TravelCenters share price and generated for Crotty an unrealized gain of $30,667.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charges Crotty with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\u00a0 Crotty has agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges, and the settlement is subject to the court\u2019s approval.\u00a0 Without denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Crotty has agreed to consent to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, imposing an officer and director bar, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $30,667, prejudgment interest of $1,274.50, and a civil penalty of $30,667.\u00a0\n\nIn a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois filed criminal charges against Crotty.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Julia Huseman and Jamie Haussecker of the Fort Worth Regional Office, under the supervision of Jim Etri and B.

George Stubos, et al.; Civil Action No. 1:22-cv-04674 (S.D.N.Y filed June 6, 2022)\n\n\n\nCourt Orders Relief Defendant in Fraudulent Microcap Scheme to Pay Over $2 Million\n\n\n\nOn April 15, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against relief defendant Dori-Ann Stubos, ordering her to pay more than $2.3 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. In June 2022, the SEC charged George Stubos for engaging in a deceptive scheme involving several microcap companies. Dori-Ann Stubos, George Stubos' wife, allegedly received illicit proceeds from George Stubos' fraudulent scheme for no legitimate purpose or consideration.\n\nThe SEC's action alleged that Canadian resident George Stubos secretly gained control of several thinly traded microcap companies whose stock was publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets, hired stock promoters to create demand for his stock, and generated substantial illicit profits by selling the stock to unsuspecting investors. Stubos allegedly misled investors, brokers, and transfer agents (companies that maintain records of stock ownership) in order to convince these parties that his stock shares were eligible for trading in the public markets, when in fact he did not register his sales of those stock shares with the Commission and did not disclose accurate information about his control over the companies. The complaint alleged that Stubos also engaged in manipulative trading to create the appearance of active market trading and thus increased investor demand for the stock. According to the complaint, George Stubos transferred some of the profits from his illicit stock sales to Dori-Ann Stubos, including for the purchase of a house in California in the name of Dori-Ann Stubos.\n\nThe court previously entered a final judgment against George Stubos by consent. George Stubos' judgment ordered him, among other relief, to pay disgorgement of $5,367,926 and prejudgment interest of $806,108. The final judgment against Dori-Ann Stubos, entered by consent, holds Dori-Ann Stubos jointly and severally liable with George Stubos for disgorgement of $1,775,000 in benefits gained as a result of George Stubos' conduct, together with $533,108 in prejudgment interest. This concludes the litigation in this matter.\n\nThe SEC's case was handled by Kathleen Shields, Alfred Day, Jennifer Cardello, and Ryan Murphy of the Boston Regional Office.\n\n\n\tFinal Judgment - Dori-Ann Stubos\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Dori-Ann Stubos\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Scott Lindell, No. 1:22-cv-08368 (S.D.N.Y. filed Sept.30, 2022)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Infinity Q\u2019s Former Senior Officer for Role in Massive Valuation Fraud\n\n\n\nOn April 12, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against defendant Scott Lindell, whom the SEC previously charged with misconduct concerning a more than $1 billion overvaluation scheme. Lindell is a former senior officer of SEC-registered investment adviser Infinity Q Capital Management LLC.\n\nThe SEC's complaint was filed on September 30, 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The SEC alleged that, from at least February 2017 through February 2021, James Velissaris, Infinity Q's founder and former Chief Investment Officer, actively manipulated the valuation models available from a certain third-party pricing service and altered inputs to mask the poor performance of the mutual fund and hedge fund that Infinity Q advised. As alleged, Lindell negligently misrepresented to investors and potential investors, representatives of the mutual fund's board, and others that the pricing service was \"independent\" of Infinity Q when, in fact, Velissaris exercised control over the pricing service. As further alleged, Lindell, at Velissaris's direction, helped Velissaris submit misleading documents to the SEC staff in response to the SEC's initial inquiries in this matter and, on one occasion, helped Velissaris mislead the mutual fund's auditor. As set forth in the complaint, Lindell also made misstatements on various Infinity Q filings with the Commission.\n\nLindell consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13b2-2, and Sections 204(a), 206(2), 206(4), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rules 204-2(a), 206(4)-7, and 206(4)-8 thereunder, ordering him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, and barring him for two years from serving as an officer or director of any SEC-reporting company.\n\nThe SEC's ongoing investigation is being conducted by Zachary Sturges and Joshua Brodsky of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit, Ming Ming Yang and Lee Greenwood of the Asset Management Unit, and Neal Jacobson, Alistaire Bambach, Kerri Palen and James Addison of the New York Regional Office. It is being supervised by Andrew Dean, Co-Chief of the Asset Management Unit, and Osman Nawaz, Chief of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit. The litigation is led by Mr. Sturges, Mr. Brodsky, Mr. Greenwood, Hayden Brockett, and Preethi Krishnamurthy. The SEC acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and the CFTC.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Friedman agreed to settle the charges that he engaged in insider trading ahead of the April 9, 2018 public announcement that Francisco Partners had agreed to acquire payment systems company Verifone Systems, Inc.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Friedman tipped his close friend, Kevin A. Van de Grift - a day-trader and licensed accountant - with material, nonpublic information concerning Francisco Partners\u2019 potential acquisition of Verifone. The SEC alleged that based on Friedman\u2019s tip, Van de Grift purchased 60,000 shares of Verifone stock from March 5, 2018 through March 9, 2018, and subsequently sold all of these shares the day after the acquisition announcement for a profit of approximately $300,000.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Friedman consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $298,000. The final judgment was entered by the Court on April 5, 2024.\n\nFriedman has also agreed to settle an administrative proceeding pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the SEC\u2019s Rules of Practice, suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant with the right to apply for reinstatement after five years.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation against Friedman was conducted by Sharan Lieberman, Michael Cates, and James McDonald and supervised by Gregory Kasper, Nicholas Heinke, and Jason Burt, all of the SEC\u2019s Denver Regional Office. The SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Michael Cates, with assistance from Daniel Konosky, and was supervised by Ian Karpel, Mr. Heinke, and Mr. Burt. The SEC acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

Cal., filed Dec. 21, 2020)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Justin Robert King for an Offering Fraud\n\n\n\nOn March 27, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against Justin Robert King, an unregistered investment adviser the SEC charged with carrying out an offering fraud.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that beginning in June 2019 King raised approximately $7.4 million from investors. The complaint further alleged that King was offering interests in an entity named Elevate Investment Fund even though no such fund existed. As alleged in the complaint, all investor money was held in brokerage and bank accounts in the name of King, his wife, and/or his company, Elevate Investments, LLC (\u201cElevate\u201d). The complaint further alleged that in offering and selling securities of the Fund, King made false and misleading statements on Elevate\u2019s publicly-accessible website and in investor account statements stating that King\u2019s trading had historically resulted in profits for his clients, including a 61% return for all of his clients\u2019 accounts from June 2019 through June 2020, when in truth King\u2019s trading resulted in substantial losses year after year.\u00a0 Elevate\u2019s website also listed certain \u201cTrusted Providers,\u201d including broker-dealers with whom King and Elevate had no current dealings.\n\nKing consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.\n\nThe final judgment against King concludes the litigation.\u00a0 Elevate, which is under receivership, had previously consented to entry of a final judgment for its role in the scheme, and King\u2019s wife, a relief defendant, consented to a judgment requiring her to repay moneys that were transferred to her.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was led by Lynn M.

Horwitz allegedly showed investors fabricated agreements and emails regarding the purported deals with HBO and Netflix. The complaint alleged that Horwitz promised investors returns in excess of 35%, and for many years paid supposed returns on earlier investments using funds from new investments. The complaint further alleged that Horwitz misappropriated investor funds for his personal use, including the purchase of his multi-million dollar home, trips to Las Vegas, and to pay a celebrity interior designer.\n\nThe Court entered a final judgment permanently enjoining Horwitz from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Horwitz was also ordered to pay disgorgement of $62,847,901.05, representing net profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $11,375,011.28, but that disgorgement figure and prejudgment interest were deemed satisfied by the restitution order entered in the parallel criminal action United States v.

Mark Borden, Civ. Action No. 1:24-cv-02621 (E.D.N.Y. filed Apr. 8, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Canadian Attorney for Selling Billions of Shares of Stock on Behalf of Others in Violation of Broker Registration Requirements\n\n\n\nOn April 8, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Canadian attorney Mark Borden with selling billions of penny stock shares on behalf of others without registering with the Commission as a broker, thereby violating the securities laws. Borden has agreed to settle the case by, among other things, paying over $335,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, between 2017 and April 2021, Borden sold penny stocks on behalf of his customers without registering with the Commission as a broker or being associated with a registered broker. Borden allegedly did so by taking possession of the stock, drafting documents that appeared to transfer ownership of the shares to himself, depositing that stock in accounts he controlled at various brokerage firms, selling those shares to retail investors often in coordination with stock promotion campaigns funded by his customers, and keeping a commission of the stock sale proceeds before disbursing the remainder to his customer. The SEC alleges that Borden and his customers understood that the customer retained beneficial ownership of the stock at all times and would receive the vast majority of the stock sale proceeds. For example, one of Borden's customers allegedly received over $15 million in stock sale proceeds from Borden in less than three years.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Eastern District of New York, charges Borden with violating the securities registration provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Borden consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions. In addition, Borden consented to a penny stock bar. Borden agreed to pay a $70,000 civil penalty, $231,363 in disgorgement, and $33,907 in prejudgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's case is being handled by Nita Klunder, David D'Addio, and Paul Block of the Boston Regional Office.\n\n\n\n        SEC Complaint\n      \n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

VWGOAF is the financing subsidiary of Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on March 14, 2019, alleges, among other things, that from April 2014 to May 2015, VWGOAF issued more than $8 billion in bonds in the U.S. markets at a time when senior Volkswagen executives knew that more than 500,000 of their vehicles in the United States grossly exceeded legal vehicle emissions limits, exposing the company to massive financial and reputational harm. The complaint alleges that VWGOAF made false and misleading statements to investors and underwriters about vehicle quality, environmental compliance, and Volkswagen\u2019s financial standing.\n\nVWGOAF, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment orders VWGOAF to pay $34.35 million in disgorgement and $14.4 million in prejudgment interest. Following the entry of the final judgment, the SEC dismissed its outstanding claims against VWGOAF\u2019s ultimate parent company, Volkswagen AG, and Volkswagen AG\u2019s former CEO, Martin Winterkorn. The Court had previously dismissed the SEC\u2019s claims against VW Credit, Inc. on August 20, 2020.\n\nThe above actions have resolved the SEC\u2019s case against Volkswagen in its entirety.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC d/b/a Commonwealth Financial Network, No. 1:19-cv-11655 (D. Mass. filed Aug. 1, 2019)\n\nSEC Obtains $93 Million Judgment Against Massachusetts Investment Adviser that Failed to Disclose Conflicts Arising from Receiving Revenue Sharing on Client Investments\n\u00a0\n\nOn March 29, 2024, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC d/b/a Commonwealth Financial Network, a registered investment adviser and broker-dealer based in Waltham, Massachusetts.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on August 1, 2019, alleged that Commonwealth failed to disclose material conflicts of interest related to revenue sharing payments it received for certain client investments. \u00a0According to the complaint, Commonwealth entered into a revenue sharing agreement with the broker that Commonwealth required most of its clients to use and received revenue sharing payments from that broker when it invested client assets in certain classes of mutual funds. \u00a0Specifically, the SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that Commonwealth failed to tell its clients that: (i) there were mutual fund share class investments that were less expensive for clients than some of the mutual fund share class investments that resulted in revenue sharing payments to Commonwealth; (ii) there were mutual fund investments that did not result in any revenue sharing payments to Commonwealth; and (iii) there were revenue sharing payments to Commonwealth under the broker\u2019s \u201ctransaction fee\u201d program. \u00a0As a result of these material omissions, Commonwealth\u2019s advisory clients invested without a full understanding of the firm\u2019s compensation motives and incentives.\u00a0 In doing so, the complaint alleged that Commonwealth violated the antifraud and compliance provisions of Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d) and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder.\n\nOn April 7, 2023, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on both claims. The Court found Commonwealth liable for failing to disclose material conflicts of interests to its advisory clients in violation of Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act and failing to adopt and implement required policies and procedures in violation of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder.\n\nOn March 29, 2024, the Court entered a final judgment ordering Commonwealth to pay $65,588,906 in disgorgement, representing the difference between the revenue sharing payments that Commonwealth received from investing clients\u2019 assets in higher-cost mutual fund share classes, and what Commonwealth\u2019s revenue sharing would have been if the clients\u2019 assets had been invested in lower-cost share classes of those funds, which paid less or no revenue sharing to Commonwealth. The Court also ordered Commonwealth to pay $21,185,162 in prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $6,500,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was handled by Richard M. Harper II, Alfred A. Day, and Naomi Sevilla of the Boston Regional Office. \u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Asset Management Unit staff in Denver, Boston and Washington, DC, including Danielle R. Voorhees, Ms. Sevilla, John Farinacci, Robert Baker and Jason Burt.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

According to the SEC\u2019s amended complaint, from at least December 2010, Churchville\u2019s and ClearPath\u2019s fraudulent conduct caused at least $27 million in losses to the private funds they advised and controlled. Churchville and ClearPath misallocated and misappropriated investor assets, used fund assets to secure undisclosed borrowing that they repaid with monies due to investors, stole approximately $2.5 million of investors\u2019 funds to purchase Churchville\u2019s waterfront home, and engaged in a multi-million-dollar Ponzi scheme, using investor money to pay off a series of prior investments. In July 2015, the Court appointed a receiver to marshal assets of the two defendants as well as the assets of the private funds advised by Churchville and ClearPath for the benefit of harmed investors. On March 16, 2017, Churchville was sentenced to 7 years in federal prison following his guilty plea to five counts of wire fraud and one count of tax evasion in connection with orchestrating the Ponzi scheme and misappropriating additional money from funds he advised. On June 1, 2022, the Court entered its final judgment and a permanent injunction against Churchville.\n\nThe final judgment against ClearPath permanently enjoins the firm from violating the antifraud, custody, and compliance provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 206(4)-2, 206(4)-7, and 206(4)-8 thereunder. The final judgment also orders ClearPath to pay, on a joint-and-several basis with Churchville, $22,553,095 in disgorgement and $4,577,810 in prejudgment interest, less any amounts distributed by the receiver or paid by Churchville as criminal restitution after the date of the final judgment.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case was handled by Marc Jones of the Boston Regional Office and Cynthia Storer Baran and Robert Baker of the Enforcement Division\u2019s Asset Management Unit.

(\u201cCodeSmart\u201d). The SEC alleged that Heineman, as chief compliance officer of Halcyon Cabot Partners, Ltd. (\u201cHalcyon\u201d), ignored red flags related to trading in CodeSmart and the conduct of one of Halcyon\u2019s registered representatives. Specifically, the SEC alleged that Heineman was aware one of the principals of the scheme was using Halcyon to facilitate his sale of CodeSmart shares while Halcyon clients were purchasing those shares. The SEC further alleged that Heineman engaged in matched trading for the purpose of inflating the price of CodeSmart securities.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged Heineman with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Heineman consented to a final judgment in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions. He agreed to pay $25,000 in civil monetary penalties.

Nielsen.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, beginning around March 2, 2020, Nielsen attempted to drive the stock price of Arrayit Corporation securities higher using online posts encouraging investors to purchase shares, including numerous messages repeating a false assertion regarding an approved COVID-19 test, without telling them about his large position in Arrayit stock or his plans to sell the shares while others were buying. Nielsen also allegedly created the false impression of high demand for Arrayit stock by placing and subsequently canceling several large orders to purchase shares in a tactic known as \"spoofing.\" According to the SEC's complaint, Nielsen made approximately $137,000 in six weeks, but based on questions regarding the accuracy and adequacy of publicly available information concerning Arrayit, the SEC temporarily\u00a0suspended trading in Arrayit securities\u00a0on April 13, 2020, before Nielsen was able to profit further from the scheme.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Nielsen consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.

Among other things, the judgment orders the defendant to pay over $1.1 million.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on May 11, 2023, alleged that GA Investors and its unknown owners fraudulently offered exorbitant returns\u2014in some cases as high as 61.9% in 24 hours\u2014for investments in various securities. Some of the websites also impersonated legitimate companies. As alleged in the complaint, investors across the world, including investors in the United States, invested approximately $85,000 in the fraudulent securities offering on the GA-Investors.org website. Investors were directed to purchase crypto assets from a separate crypto asset trading platform and transfer those crypto assets to a GA Investors wallet address. Although some investors were able to make small withdrawals from their accounts, when the investors sought to recoup larger portions of their investments, the defendants froze investor accounts and misappropriated the investor funds.\n\nThe final judgment, which was entered by default, enjoins GA Investors from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also bars GA Investors from participating in future offerings of securities. In addition, the judgment orders GA Investors to pay disgorgement in the amount of $70,058, plus prejudgment interest of $5,740, and a civil penalty of $1,116,140.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation in this matter is now concluded.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) has issued Investor Alerts warning investors about fraudulent crypto trading websites and crypto investment scams.\u00a0Additionally, OIEA and the FBI jointly warn investors about fraudsters who falsely claim to be registered\u2014or who impersonate registered investment professionals\u2014in order to lure investors into scams.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case was handled by Kerry Dakin, Alyssa DiPaolo, Sean Fishkind, David London, Russell Mawn, John McCann, and Celia Moore, of the SEC\u2019s Boston Regional Office.\n\nSee Final Judgment\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Treusch, No. 1:24-civ-01050 (E.D.N.Y. filed Feb. 11, 2024)\n\nSEC Charges Additional Defendant for Role in Lucrative \u201cFree-Riding\u201d Scheme\n\u00a0\n\nOn February 11, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Travis Treusch, a Long Island, New York resident, in connection with his role in a multi-year \u201cfree-riding\u201d scheme. Treusch consented to a partial resolution of the charges.\u00a0The SEC previously charged Eduardo Hernandez, Christopher Flagg, Daquan Lloyd, and Corey Ortiz, also all currently or formerly of Long Island, New York, for their roles in the scheme that generated more than $2 million in illicit profits.\n\nThe SEC alleges that, from approximately July 2020 through January 2022, Treusch aided and abetted Hernandez and Flagg (the \u201cPrincipals\u201d) in a free-riding scheme, in which the Principals opened and used unfunded brokerage accounts (the loser accounts) to generate trading profits in other brokerage accounts that they also controlled (the winner accounts). The complaint alleges the Principals maintained the loser accounts at a broker that provided an instant deposit credit, which they used to fund trades at manipulated prices. The complaint alleges that in doing so, the Principals essentially transferred the credit provided by the broker from the loser accounts to the winner accounts, accumulating guaranteed profits at the broker\u2019s expense. The complaint alleges that Treusch opened a loser account himself and recruited others to do the same for use in the scheme, and then provided the Principals with the account login credentials so the Principals could access and control the loser accounts in the names of those recruited, thereby deceiving the brokers. The SEC alleges that Treusch also recruited at least two individuals to set up accounts and cede control of them to Hernandez, who used them as winner accounts in the scheme. According to the complaint, Treusch was compensated for each account he secured for the scheme.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charges Treusch with aiding and abetting the Principals\u2019 violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Treusch consented to a bifurcated judgment enjoining him from violations of the charged provisions and a conduct-based injunction, with the duration of the conduct-based injunction and the amount of monetary relief to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC. The settlement is subject to Court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Cynthia A. Matthews, David Austin, Matthew Lambert, John Marino, Pat McCluskey and Lindsay S. Moilanen of the New York Regional Office and the SEC Enforcement Division\u2019s Market Abuse Unit, and is being supervised by Joseph Sansone. The SEC\u2019s Office of Market Intelligence provided assistance.

The complaint alleged that Felton promised to build a digital streaming platform for FLiK, and a digital asset trading platform for CoinSpark. Instead, Felton allegedly misappropriated the funds raised in the ICOs. The complaint also alleged that Felton secretly transferred FLiK tokens to himself and sold them into the market, reaping an additional $2.2 million in profits, and that he engaged in manipulative trading to inflate the price of SPARK tokens. Felton allegedly used the funds he misappropriated and the proceeds of his manipulative trading to buy a Ferrari, a million-dollar home, diamond jewelry, and other luxury goods.\n\nFelton, FLiK, and CoinSpark consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violations of Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; permanently enjoining Felton from violations of Section 9(a)(1) of the Exchange Act; permanently enjoining Felton, FLiK, and CoinSpark from participating, directly or indirectly, in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any digital asset security; permanently barring Felton from acting as an officer or director of a public company; and ordering joint and several disgorgement in the amount of $2.8 million, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $704,981, to be deemed satisfied by the criminal judgment and restitution and forfeiture orders entered against Felton by the United States District Court in United States v.

Matthew Nicosia, William Reininger, Fabrizio Di Carlo, and Ronald Touchard, Civ. Action No. 1:22-cv-05761 (E.D.N.Y. filed Sept. 27, 2022)\n\n\n\nOn March 27, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment against Canadian resident Fabrizio Di Carlo whom the SEC had charged for his role in a microcap fraud scheme targeting retail investors. Among other things, the judgment orders Di Carlo to pay a total of over $140,000.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 27, 2022, from August 2019 to at least September 2020, DiCarlo, along with co-defendants Matthew Nicosia, William Reininger, and Ronald Touchard, worked with others to fraudulently sell stock in microcap companies by making misleading statements during high pressure sales calls and/or email promotions. The SEC alleges that, as part of the scheme, Touchard introduced Nicosia and Reininger to Di Carlo, who identified and called potential investors to pressure them to purchase stock in Odyssey Group International Inc. According to the complaint, Nicosia and Reininger were Odyssey insiders working with an individual previously charged by the SEC, Charlie Abujudeh, to dump Odyssey shares during the promotional campaigns they were funding. The SEC alleges that Di Carlo and his stock promoters were deceptive and failed to disclose that Nicosia and Reininger were Odyssey insiders, controlled nearly all of the stock that was deposited and available for public trading, and were selling their Odyssey stock into the increased demand created by the promotions they were funding and controlling.\n\nThe final judgment, entered by default against Di Carlo, enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment orders Di Carlo to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of more than $43,970, a civil penalty of $100,000, and imposes a penny stock bar.\n\nThe SEC staff responsible for this matter include David D'Addio, Nita Klunder, and Paul Block of the Boston Regional Office.

The SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that Fernandez acted as a middleman for the promotional scheme. According to the complaint, Fernandez arranged to receive a percentage of investor funds raised by the issuers, in exchange for arranging the promotions under the guise of consulting agreements with the issuers. The complaint also alleged that Fernandez tried to disguise his receipt of payments from the issuers by submitting invoices for fake consulting services, and by funneling payments through offshore accounts for a co-defendant\u2019s benefit.\n\nFernandez consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoined Fernandez from: (1) violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(3), and 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c)thereunder; and (2) directly or indirectly, including, but not limited to, through any entity he owns or controls, assisting with, facilitating, or receiving compensation in any form for a Promotional Campaign related to any security. Fernandez was also ordered to pay disgorgement of $458,160, representing net profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $41,557.44. Based on Fernandez\u2019s cooperation in a Commission investigation and related enforcement action, Fernandez was not ordered to pay a civil penalty.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was led by Charles Canter and supervised by Douglas M.

The SEC alleges that Bechtolsheim, who was Arista Networks\u2019s chair at the time, learned of Acacia\u2019s impending acquisition on July 8, 2019, through his and Arista Networks\u2019s longstanding relationship with another multinational technology company that was also considering acquiring Acacia and consulted with Bechtolsheim concerning the potential acquisition. Immediately after learning this information, Bechtolsheim allegedly traded Acacia options in the accounts of a close relative and an associate. The next day, July 9, 2019, before the market opened, Acacia and Cisco announced that Cisco had agreed to acquire Acacia for $70 per share. That day, Acacia\u2019s stock price increased by 35.1 percent. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Bechtolsheim\u2019s trading generated combined illegal profits of $415,726 in the accounts of his relative and associate.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, charges Bechtolsheim with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Bechtolsheim, without admitting or denying the charges, has agreed to entry of a judgment, subject to court approval, imposing a permanent injunction, a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and a civil monetary penalty of $923,740.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by John P. Mogg of the Division of Enforcement\u2019s Market Abuse Unit in the San Francisco Regional Office with assistance from Patrick McCluskey, John S. Rymas, and Ainsley Kerr of the Market Abuse Unit\u2019s Analysis and Detection Center. The matter was supervised by Assistant Director Rahul Kolhatkar and Unit Chief Joseph G. Sansone. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Mass. filed June 13, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Individual in Stock Selling Scheme\n\n\n\nOn March 19, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgments against California resident Kevin C. Dills and two entities that Dills controlled.\n\nThe SEC charged Dills and Joseph Padilla in June 2023 for their roles in a fraudulent stock selling scheme.\u00a0 According to the complaint, Padilla engaged in a fraudulent scheme for his own benefit and also on behalf of individuals who paid Padilla to arrange illegal stock sales. \u00a0The complaint alleges that those individuals hid their identities by selling stock through offshore accounts in different names that Padilla arranged.\u00a0 From early 2020 into 2022, Dills allegedly conspired with Padilla to sell stock of Oncology Pharma, Inc., a company that Dills secretly controlled, while avoiding legal requirements for a control person\u2019s sale of stock to the public.\u00a0 According to the complaint, Dills acquired and sold Oncology Pharma stock through two other entities that he controlled, Bright Star International, Inc. and Life Sciences Journeys, Inc.\u00a0 Dills allegedly transferred stock to individuals associated with Padilla and then allegedly received proceeds of illegal stock sales from Padilla.\u00a0 During this period, Dills allegedly used his influence over Oncology Pharma to have it issue press releases designed to make its stock more appealing to investors.\u00a0 The complaint alleged that Dills, by dividing his Oncology Pharma ownership between two front companies, transferring shares to Padilla, and then sharing in the proceeds of Padilla\u2019s illegal sales, purposely flouted the registration requirements of federal securities law.\n\nDills consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\u00a0 The judgment imposes a penny stock bar and additional injunctive relief and orders Dills to pay a $223,229 penalty.\u00a0 The judgment further orders Dills to pay disgorgement of $6,225,448 and prejudgment interest of $786,645 on a joint-and-several basis with Bright Star International and Life Sciences Journeys.\u00a0 The court also entered final judgments by consent against relief defendants Bright Star International and Life Sciences Journeys, ordering them to pay $6,920,345 and $91,747, respectively, in disgorgement and prejudgment interest on a joint and several basis with Dills.\u00a0 The judgments provide that disgorgement may be offset by a dollar amount that Dills has separately agreed to pay to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts in a plea agreement to resolve a related criminal action.\u00a0 If the court in the criminal action does not accept Dill\u2019s plea agreement, then Dills would owe full disgorgement to the Commission.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case is being handled by Ryan Murphy, Michael Moran, Kathleen Shields, and Amy Gwiazda of the Boston Regional Office.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Parekh is a resident of Massachusetts.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 13, 2023, from at least the fourth quarter of 2016 through August 2018, Parekh, as the Finance Director of Evoqua's division based in Rhode Island, engaged in fraudulent accounting practices that resulted in Evoqua improperly reporting materially false revenue amounts in its financial statements filed with the Commission.\n\nThe final judgment, entered by consent, orders Parekh to pay a civil money penalty of $40,000, orders disgorgement of $5,489 plus prejudgment interest of $1,342, and bars Parekh for ten years from serving as an officer or director of a public company.\n\nOn July 10, 2023, the court previously entered a partial judgment by consent against Parekh that permanently enjoined him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10(b)-5 thereunder; from aiding and abetting any violation of the periodic reporting provisions of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-l, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; from aiding and abetting any violation of the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act; from knowingly circumventing an issuer's system of accounting controls or knowingly falsifying an issuer's books and records in violation of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act; and from violating Rule 13b2-1 of the Exchange Act by falsifying or causing to be falsified any books, records, or internal accounts. On July 10, 2023, the court also entered a final judgment by consent against Evoqua.\n\nThe case was handled by Kerry Vasta, Jonathan Allen, Peter Moores, David London, and Amy Gwiazda of the Boston Regional Office.\n\n\n\tFinal Judgment - Evoqua Water Technologies\n\tFinal Judgment - Imran Parekh\n\tPartial Judgment - Imran Parekh\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Evoqua Water Technologies\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Imran Parekh\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Partial Judgment - Imran Parekh\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Today\u2019s complaint follows the SEC\u2019s successful emergency action in September 2022 that halted the CryptoFX scheme and charged its two main principals, Mauricio Chavez and Giorgio Benvenuto.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, CryptoFX purported to trade in crypto asset and foreign exchange markets for investors but was in reality a Ponzi scheme. The SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that, from May 2020 to October 2022, the 17 charged individuals from Texas, California, Louisiana, Illinois, and Florida, acted as leaders of the CryptoFX network and solicited investors by variously promising that CryptoFX\u2019s crypto asset and foreign exchange trading would generate returns of 15 to 100 percent. The complaint alleges that CryptoFX raised $300 million from investors but did not use most of the funds for its claimed trading purposes. Instead, the defendants allegedly used investor funds to pay supposed returns to other investors, to pay commissions and bonuses to themselves and investors, and to fund their own lifestyles. The complaint further alleges that two of the defendants, spouses Gabriel and Dulce Ochoa, continued to solicit investments after the court issued orders to halt the CryptoFX scheme in September 2022, and Gabriel Ochoa instructed two investors to rescind their complaints to the SEC for them to recover their investments. Another defendant, Maria Saravia, allegedly told investors that the SEC\u2019s lawsuit was fake.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, charges Gabriel and Dulce Ochoa, Saravia, Gloria Castaneda, Ismael Zarco Sanchez, and Roberto Zavala with violating the antifraud, securities-registration, and broker-registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint charges Gabriel Arguelles, Hector Aquino, Orlin Wilifredo Turcios Castro, Carmen De La Cruz, Elizabeth Escoto, Reyna Guiffaro, Marco Antonio Lemus, Juan Puac, Luis Serrano, Julio Taffinder, and Claudia Velazquez with violating the securities-registration and broker-registration provisions. In addition, the complaint charges Gabriel Ochoa with violating the whistleblower protection provisions. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each defendant.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Serrano and Taffinder consented to the entry of final judgments, subject to court approval, that permanently restrain and enjoin them from violating the securities-registration and broker-registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Serrano and Taffinder agreed to pay more than $68,000 combined in civil penalties, disgorgement, and interest.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Jillian Harris, Carol Hahn, and Jamie Haussecker of the Fort Worth Regional Office and was supervised by Jim Etri and B. David Fraser. The litigation is being conducted by Matthew Gulde and supervised by Keefe Bernstein.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Roy M. Cook, Jeffrey A. Natrop, Peter S. Renner, James Rudolph and Peter Williams, No. YY-civ-#### (E.D. Wis. filed Mar. 1, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Former Energy Company Official and Four Others with Insider Trading\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges against Roy Cook, a former member of the Board of Directors of Tallgrass Energy LP(\u201cTallgrass\u201d), and four of his friends for trading on material nonpublic information in advance of a corporate acquisition involving the Kansas-based energy company. The SEC also charged Cook for failing to file required disclosure reports concerning securities transactions by family trusts.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, alleges that Cook, a resident of Hartland, Wisconsin, learned material nonpublic information about a potential acquisition offer for Tallgrass and tipped his friends, Jeffrey Natrop, Peter Renner, James Rudolph and Peter Williams, the information in advance of August and December 2019 public announcements concerning the offer. The complaint alleges that based on inside information from Cook, Natrop and Renner, co-owners of a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, architecture firm and friends and business associates of Cook\u2019s, purchased Tallgrass call options on August 8 and 9, 2019. The complaint further alleges that Cook tipped Rudolph and Rudolph purchased Tallgrass stock on August 6, 2019. The complaint also alleges that Cook tipped Williams, his long-time friend and personal accountant, and that Williams purchased call options on August 19 and 21, 2019.\n\nFollowing the August announcement, which saw Tallgrass shares increase by 36 percent, Cook served for several months as chair of a Tallgrass Conflicts Committee tasked with assessing the acquisition offer and negotiating the final terms of the transaction. In connection with this role, Cook allegedly learned material nonpublic information about the status of the negotiations that he communicated to Williams, who purchased Tallgrass stock in a Cook family trust account over which he had trading authority. The complaint further alleges that on December 10, 2019, Cook tipped Williams more material nonpublic information about the status of the negotiations, and Williams purchased more call options in his personal account.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, each Defendant consented to a permanent injunction prohibiting them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, with Cook also agreeing to an injunction under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. Cook has agreed to disgorge his illicit trading profits of $88,800, with prejudgment interest of $15,479, and pay a civil penalty of $801,742. Cook has also agreed to an officer-and-director bar. Each of the other Defendants has agreed to disgorge their illicit trading profits \u2013 $43,862 for Natrop, $13,520 for Renner, $31,035 for Rudolph, and $524,525 for Williams \u2013 along with prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty equal to their disgorgement.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by David Frisof and Brian Vann, with assistance from Dean Conway, James Carlson and Brian Shute. The case was supervised by Brian Quinn.

Ishan Wahi et al., No. 22-civ-01009 (W.D. Wash. filed July 21, 2022)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Default Judgment Against Friend of Former Coinbase Manager for Insider Trading in Crypto Asset Securities\n\n\n\nOn March 1, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a final judgment against Sameer Ramani, who was previously charged for engaging in insider trading through a scheme to trade ahead of multiple announcements regarding at least nine crypto asset securities that would be made available for trading on the Coinbase platform.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that Ramani received tips from his friend, Ishan Wahi, who was then a product manager at Coinbase and helped to coordinate the platform\u2019s public listing announcements. These announcements included what crypto assets would be made available for trading. According to the complaint, Coinbase treated such information as confidential and warned its employees not to trade on the basis of, or tip others with, that information. The complaint alleges that, from at least June 2021 to April 2022, in breach of his duties, Ishan repeatedly tipped the timing and content of upcoming listing announcements to Ramani and to Nikhil Wahi, Ishan\u2019s brother. Ahead of those announcements, which usually resulted in an increase in the assets\u2019 prices, Ramani and Nikhil Wahi allegedly purchased at least 25 crypto assets, at least nine of which were securities, and then typically sold them shortly after the announcements for a profit.\n\nThe judgment, entered on the basis of default, enjoined Ramani from violating the anti-fraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment ordered Ramani to pay disgorgement of $817,602 and a civil penalty of $1,635,204. The court previously entered final judgments against Ishan and Nikhil Wahi, so the final judgment against Ramani concludes the litigation in this matter.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Daniel Maher and Peter Lallas, and supervised by James Connor and Olivia Choe.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Jan. 24, 2023)\n\n\n\nCourt Enters Final Judgment Against Wisconsin Investment Adviser For Defrauding Seniors\n\n\n\nOn February 28, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin entered a final judgment against Anthony B. Liddle, formerly of Wausau, Wisconsin. Liddle operated Prosper Wealth Management, LLC, an investment adviser formerly registered with the State of Wisconsin.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on January 24, 2023, alleged that Liddle, while acting as an investment adviser, fabricated documents and made misrepresentations to clients, many of whom were seniors. Liddle misrepresented that these clients\u2019 portfolios had become too risky and needed to be replaced with less risky securities. These \u201cless risky\u201d securities were often rated as high risk and were also unavailable. Liddle had advisory clients send money directly to his investment advisory company, where Liddle misappropriated client funds and never invested the money on his clients\u2019 behalf. \u00a0Liddle also fabricated statements and made purported investment payments to advisory clients that were, in fact, coming from defrauded client funds.\n\nThe final judgment, which was entered by consent, enjoins Liddle from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The judgment also bars Liddle from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act.\u00a0 In addition, the judgment orders Liddle to pay disgorgement in the amount of $1,662,041.80, but deems this obligation fully satisfied by the entry of a restitution order in a parallel criminal case filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, in which Liddle pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering and was sentenced to serve 97 months in prison.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation in this matter is now concluded.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Matthew T. Wissa and Scott Hlavacek and supervised by Amy S. Cotter of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation was handled by Mr. Wissa and Ms. Cotter.\n\nThe SEC appreciates the assistance of the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions \u2013 Division of Securities, the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\n\n\n\nFinal Judgment\u00a0\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Harmel S. Rayat, RenovaCare, Inc., Jatinder Bhogal, Jeetenderjit Singh Sidhu, and Sharon Fleming, No. 1:21-cv-04777 (S.D.N.Y.)\n\n\n\nFinal Judgments Entered Against Harmel S. Rayat, Jatinder Bhogal, and RenovaCare, Inc. in Microcap Fraud Case\n\n\n\nOn February 27, 2024, the Honorable Lewis J. Liman entered final judgments against defendants Harmel S. Rayat, Jatinder Bhogal, and RenovaCare, Inc., along with relief defendant 1420527 Alberta Ltd., in SEC v. Harmel S. Rayat, et al., No. 1:21\u2011cv\u201104771, a case in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The SEC\u2019s amended complaint, filed on August 30, 2022, charges Rayat, a Canadian citizen and controlling shareholder of RenovaCare, Bhogal, a Canadian citizen and former advisor and chief operating officer of RenovaCare, and RenovaCare, a Nevada corporation purportedly developing a medical device called the \u201cSkinGun,\u201d with securities fraud. The amended complaint alleges the defendants conducted a fraudulent \u201cpump and dump\u201d scheme that included materially false statements to investors, undisclosed sales of shares while promoting the stock, and manipulative trading. The amended complaint also charges other associates of Rayat and Bhogal, and names several relief defendants, including 1420527 Alberta Ltd., an entity Bhogal owns and controls. Rayat, Bhogal, and RenovaCare consented to the final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations.\n\nThe final judgment against Rayat permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and Sections 10(b) and 20(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; prohibits Rayat from acting as an officer or director of a public company; bars Rayat from participating in the offering of any penny stock; and orders Rayat to pay disgorgement of $1,270,352, prejudgment interest of $207,656, and a civil penalty of $1,270,352.\n\nThe final judgment against Bhogal permanently enjoins him from violating Securities Act Section 17(a) and Exchange Act Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; prohibits Bhogal from acting as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years; bars Bhogal from participating in the offering of any penny stock; orders Bhogal and 1420527 Alberta Ltd. to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $1,136,182 and prejudgment interest of $194,562; and orders Bhogal to pay a civil penalty of $669,687.\n\nThe final judgment against RenovaCare permanently enjoins the company from violating Securities Act Section 17(a) and Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 15(d) and Rules 12b-20 and 15d-11; and orders the company to pay a civil penalty of $500,000.\n\nThe court previously entered final judgments against Sharon Fleming (also known as Sharon Hebgin) and Jeetenderjit \u201cJeet\u201d Singh Sidhu. These final judgments against Rayat, Bhogal, and RenovaCare conclude the litigation.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Darren E. Long, with the assistance of Brian Shute and Jessica Regan, and supervised by Brian O. Quinn and Carolyn M. Welshhans. The litigation was led by Matthew Scarlato and John J. Bowers and supervised by James Carlson.\n\nFor further information, see Litigation Release Nos. 25102, 25487, and 25883.\n\n\n\tFinal Judgment \u2013 Harmel S.

Christopher R. Esposito, et al., No. 1:16-cv-10960 (D. Mass. filed May 26, 2016)\n\n\n\nCourt Enters Final Judgment Against Microcap Consultant Involved in Fraudulent Scheme\n\n\n\nOn February 12, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Anthony Jay Pignatello of Winchester, Virginia. Pignatello was a consultant and Secretary for Cannabiz Mobile, Inc., a publicly traded company purportedly servicing medical marijuana businesses.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on May 26, 2016, alleged that Pignatello, along with other named defendants, engaged in a scheme to defraud investors. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Pignatello and Christopher Esposito of Topsfield, Massachusetts, concealed Esposito\u2019s ownership and control of Cannabiz to enrich themselves by facilitating the sale of hundreds of millions of shares of Cannabiz stock into the public market. The SEC alleged that, between early 2014 and August 2015, Pignatello and Esposito concealed Esposito\u2019s de facto control of Cannabiz and a large percentage of Cannabiz\u2019s securities in attempt to evade SEC Rule 144, which limits securities sales by affiliates, such as control persons. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Pignatello\u2019s actions allowed Esposito to sell significant amounts of Cannabiz convertible debt for almost $304,000. In addition, Pignatello, Esposito, and Renee Galizio of Loxahatchee, Florida, sold millions of shares of Cannabiz stock directly into the public market.\n\nThe final judgment, which was entered by consent, enjoins Pignatello from future violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also bars Pignatello from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and permanently bars him from participating in an offering of a penny stock. In addition, the judgment orders Pignatello to pay disgorgement and pre-judgment interest in the total amount of $43,337, but deems this obligation fully satisfied by the entry of a forfeiture order in a parallel criminal case filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, in which Pignatello pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud.\n\nThe court previously entered final default judgments against Gondolfe, Cannabiz, Lionshare Ventures LLC, and Esposito and entered a final judgment by consent against Galizio.\n\nThe litigation is now concluded as to all the defendants.\n\n\n\tFinal Judgment - Anthony Jay Pignatello\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Anthony Jay Pignatello\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

The SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that, between at least 2019 and April 2023, Feloni and Stock Squirrel deceived approximately 180 retail investors into giving them almost $2.5 million by claiming that they would use investors\u2019 money for Stock Squirrel\u2019s business, principally by developing a smartphone application offering financial services to the fast-growing youth sector. Instead, according to the complaint, Feloni misappropriated approximately $1.6 million of investor funds\u201466% of the total amount raised from investors\u2014for his own use and made Ponzi-like payments to prior investors.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Feloni and Stock Squirrel consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and imposing, on a joint-and-several basis, disgorgement of $1,719,871 and prejudgment interest of $158,839.51. Feloni further consented to the entry of a final judgment: (1) ordering him to pay a $223,229 civil penalty; (2) prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of any public company; (3) imposing a penny stock bar; and (4) enjoining him from participating, directly or indirectly, including but not limited to through any entity he owns or controls, in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, or engaging in activities for purposes of inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any security; provided, however, that such injunction shall not prevent Feloni from purchasing or selling securities for his own personal account.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case was handled by David Fox, David London, Kerry Vasta, and Amy Gwiazda of the Boston Regional Office.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Arline E. Woodbury and Joyce L. Holverson, No. 1:23-cv-14255 (N.D. Ill. filed Sept. 28, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgments Against Promoters of Multi-Million Dollar CoinDeal Scheme\n\n\n\nOn February 7, 2024, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered final judgments on all claims against two CoinDeal promoters, Arline Woodbury of Ridgewood, New Jersey and Joyce Holverson of River Forest, Illinois.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that Woodbury and Holverson acted as downstream promoters for the CoinDeal scheme, through which investors would supposedly generate astronomical returns from the imminent sale of an anonymous blockchain technology. According to the complaint, Woodbury and Holverson formed their own investor groups to take advantage of bonuses and payouts offered through CoinDeal. The complaint alleged that Woodbury and Holverson raised more than $3 million from hundreds of investors based on dissemination of materially false and misleading statements about the deal and collectively misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars of investor funds for personal use. According to the complaint, no sale of CoinDeal ever occurred and investors received no distributions.\n\nWoodbury did not answer or otherwise respond to the SEC\u2019s complaint. In an order entering default judgment, the Court found that Woodbury violated the registration and antifraud provisions of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by the alleged orchestrator of the scheme, Neil Chandran. In addition, the Court: (i) permanently enjoined Woodbury from future violations; (ii) entered an officer-and-director bar against Woodbury; and (iii) ordered Woodbury to pay disgorgement of $199,151 plus prejudgment interest of $47,991 and a $230,464 civil penalty.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Holverson consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the registration and antifraud provisions of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Holverson also consented to the entry of an officer-and-director bar and to pay disgorgement of $164,308 plus prejudgment interest of $25,778 and a $175,000 civil penalty.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was handled by Michael D. Foster, Dante A. Roldan, and Caryn Trombino, with assistance from Steven Tremaglio and Lynette Nichols-Newman, all of the Chicago Regional Office.\n\nThe SEC filed a related action in federal court on January 4, 2023 against eight additional defendants, including Chandran.

Auerbach et al., No. 1:19-cv-5631 (E.D.N.Y. filed October 4, 2019)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Defendant for Role in Bribery Scheme\n\n\n\nOn February 5, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against defendant Jeffrey Auerbach, whom the SEC previously charged for his role in a fraudulent scheme to bribe a stockbroker to buy a company\u2019s stock in his customers\u2019 accounts without the customers\u2019 knowledge. \u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint was filed on October 4, 2019, in federal district court in the Eastern District of New York. From approximately July 2014 through October 2015, Auerbach and another defendant allegedly entered into \u201cconsulting agreements\u201d with the CEO of Nxt-ID, Inc., a publicly-traded security technology company. The SEC alleged these agreements were actually a guise through which Auerbach funneled cash bribes from the CEO to another defendant, a registered stockbroker, to buy Nxt-ID stock in customers\u2019 accounts.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Auerbach consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment orders disgorgement of $3,000.00, representing Auerbach\u2019s ill-gotten gains as a result of the conduct alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, together with prejudgment interest of $5,846, but it deems the obligation to pay these amounts satisfied by the entry of the restitution order against Auerbach in the parallel criminal action filed against Auerbach based on the same conduct alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, United States v. Auerbach, 19 Cr. 607 (E.D.N.Y.). The final judgment does not impose civil penalties in light of Auerbach\u2019s conviction and sentence in the criminal proceeding.\n\nThe litigation is being led by Lindsay S.

Cal. filed Nov. 9, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgments Against Former Co-CEOs of Tech Startup Bitwise Industries\n\n\n\nOn January 31, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California entered judgments against Jake Soberal and Irma Olguin, Jr., the former co-CEOs of Fresno, California-based private technology services startup Bitwise Industries Inc., in an action alleging that they misled investors about the company\u2019s finances.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on November 9, 2023, alleged that Soberal and Olguin made material misrepresentations and falsified documents concerning Bitwise\u2019s cash position and historical financial performance while raising approximately $70 million from investors in 2022. According to the complaint, Soberal and Olguin created and provided investors with falsified bank records and a fake audit report that showed, respectively, inflated cash balances and higher revenues than Bitwise actually generated. Soberal and Olguin\u2019s alleged misrepresentations and falsified materials painted Bitwise as a healthy, growing business with favorable financial performance. In reality, and as Soberal and Olguin allegedly knew, Bitwise faced constant cash shortages and was often on the brink of failure because it was unable to generate sufficient funds from its operations. As alleged, Soberal and Olguin\u2019s scheme came to light in May 2023 when Bitwise failed to make payroll and abruptly furloughed\u2014and then terminated\u2014all of its hundreds of personnel.\n\nThe judgments enjoin Soberal and Olguin from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgments further impose conduct-based injunctions as well as officer-and-director bars against both defendants, and reserve the issues of disgorgement and civil penalties for further determination by the court. Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Soberal and Olguin consented to the entry of the judgments.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Drew Liming and John Roscigno, under the supervision of Rahul Kolhatkar and Jason H.

Del. filed February 2, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Founder of American Bitcoin Academy Online Crypo Course with Fraud Targeting Students\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Brian Sewell and his company, Rockwell Capital Management agreed to settle fraud charges in connection with a scheme that targeted students taking Sewell\u2019s online crypto trading course known as the American Bitcoin Academy. The SEC alleges that the fraudulent scheme cost 15 students $1.2 million.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from at least early 2018 to mid-2019, Sewell encouraged hundreds of his online students to invest in the Rockwell Fund, a hedge fund that he claimed he would launch, and which would use cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and trading strategies involving crypto assets to generate returns for investors. The complaint alleges that Sewell, who resided in Hurricane, Utah, before relocating to Puerto Rico, received approximately $1.2 million from 15 students but never launched the fund nor executed the trading strategies he advertised to investors, instead holding on to the invested money in bitcoin. The complaint further alleges that the bitcoin was eventually stolen when Sewell\u2019s digital wallet was hacked and looted.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, charges the defendants with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The defendants have agreed to settle the charges. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants have consented to injunctive relief. Defendant Rockwell Capital Management also agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $1,602,089 and Defendant Sewell agreed to a civil penalty of $223,229. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Matthew S. Raalf and Jacquelyn D. King with assistance from Gregory Bockin and Karen M.

Ill.) filed June 27, 2019\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Municipal Advisor Charged with Breaching Fiduciary Duty\n\n\n\nOn January 30, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against defendants Comer Capital Group, LLC and Brandon L. Comer, whom the SEC previously charged with breaching their fiduciary duty in connection with a $6 million municipal bond offering by the Harvey Public Library District in Harvey, Illinois.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint was filed on June 27, 2019 in federal district court in Chicago, Illinois. The complaint alleged that Mississippi-based municipal advisor Comer Capital Group, LLC and its managing partner, Brandon L. Comer, failed to protect the interests of their client, the Library District. According to the complaint, the Library District hired Comer Capital and Comer to assist with the bond offering process, including to provide advice on: (1) the selection of an experienced underwriter, and (2) the pricing of the bonds. The SEC alleged that Comer Capital and Comer did not provide advice to the Library District on the qualifications of the underwriter and, upon learning that the underwriter was having difficulty finding investors to buy the bonds, did not consider or recommend that the District consider engaging a different or an additional broker-dealer to underwrite the bonds. The SEC also alleged that Comer Capital and Comer did not provide the Library District with the information and advice needed to determine whether the price of the bonds was fair and reasonable. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, the price was not fair and reasonable and the mispricing of the bonds will cause the Library District to pay more than $500,000 in additional interest over the life of the bonds. The complaint charged the defendants with breaching their fiduciary duties in violation of Section 15B(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Comer Capital and Comer consented to entry of a final judgment ordering Comer Capital to pay disgorgement in the amount of $25,000 plus prejudgment interest thereon. The final judgment also ordered Comer Capital and Comer to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $30,000 and $20,000, respectively.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Natalie Garner of the Public Finance Abuse Unit and the Chicago Regional Office with assistance from Joseph O.

Crowd Machine, Inc., Metavine, Inc., and Craig Sproule, Defendants, and Metavine Pty. Ltd., Relief Defendant,\nNo. 4:22-cv-0076-HSG (N.D. Cal. filed Jan. 6, 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nIssuers Ordered to Disgorge More Than $19.6 Million Raised in Unregistered and Fraudulent Crypto Asset Securities Offering and Pay $1.2 Million in Civil Penalties\n\n\n\nOn January 17, 2024, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California issued an amended final judgment[1] ordering defendants Crowd Machine, Inc. and Metavine, Inc. to disgorge $19,676,401.27 raised from investors in an unregistered and fraudulent offering of crypto asset securities, plus $3,358,147.75 in prejudgment interest. The Court held relief defendant and affiliate Metavine Pty. Ltd. liable, jointly and severally with the defendants, for disgorgement of $5 million. The Court also ordered defendants to pay civil penalties of $600,000, each.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged defendants Crowd Machine and Metavine and founder Craig Sproule for making materially false and misleading statements in connection with the unregistered offer and sale of crypto asset securities they referred to as \u201cCrowd Machine Compute Tokens\u201d or \u201cCMCTs.\u201d Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, defendants previously consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b\u20115 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act. The consent judgments, entered January 11, 2022, also enjoined defendants from participating in future securities offerings, ordered them to permanently disable CMCTs in their possession and seek the removal of CMCTs from crypto trading platforms, and as to Sproule, imposed a $195,047 civil penalty and prohibited him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The prior consent judgments fully resolved the SEC\u2019s action against Mr. Sproule, but left the Court to determine the monetary relief to be paid by the remaining defendants.\n\nThe Court\u2019s final judgment followed an order, issued December 5, 2023, granting in part the SEC\u2019s motion for monetary relief.

Aryeh Goldstein, Adar Bays, LLC, and Adar Alef, LLC, No. 1:24-CV-20261 (S.D. Fla. filed Jan. 23, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Convertible Note Dealer for Failure to Register; Defendants Agree to Pay $1.25 Million to Settle\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of an enforcement action against Aryeh Goldstein, a resident of Florida and New York, and two entities he controls, Adar Bays, LLC, located in Florida, and Adar Alef, LLC, doing business in Florida and New York, for failing to register as securities dealers in connection with their convertible note financing business that involved obtaining and selling securities of over 100 microcap companies. The parties have agreed to settle the charges. Among other relief, Goldstein and his entities agreed to pay $1.25 million in monetary relief and to surrender or cancel all remaining shares of public companies allegedly obtained from their unregistered dealer activity.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that, from at least 2014 through October 2021, the defendants operated as unregistered securities dealers in connection with their convertible note financing of 134 different microcap companies. According to the complaint, the defendants\u2019 business involved loaning money to these microcap companies in exchange for promissory notes that, under certain circumstances, allowed the defendants to convert the debt into shares of the companies. The complaint alleges that the convertible note financing business allowed the defendants to obtain a large number of shares of these microcap companies, which the defendants then sold into the securities marketplace under circumstances that required the defendants to register with the SEC as securities dealers. As further alleged in the complaint, through this business, and without registering as dealers or being associated with a registered dealer, the defendants generated significant profits through the regular sale of billions of converted shares to investors.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Goldstein, Adar Bays, and Adar Alef consented to the entry of separate final judgments: (i) enjoining them from violating Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (ii) ordering payment of disgorgement of $1,044,252 plus prejudgment interest of $100,748 on a joint and several basis and, as to Goldstein, a civil penalty of $105,000; (iii) ordering them to surrender for cancellation all remaining shares they obtained through conversion of notes, as well as conversion rights under any remaining convertible notes; and (iv) imposing five-year penny stock bars against each defendant. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's litigation is being handled by Alfred Day, Lauchlan Wash, Ellen Moynihan, Kevin Currid, and Rory Alex of the SEC's Boston Regional Office, with assistance from Alex Lefferts of the Division of Enforcement's Office of Investigative & Market Analytics.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

The final judgments permanently enjoin Grenda Group and Gregory Grenda from future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cthe Advisers Act\u201d), and order Grenda Group and Gregory Grenda to pay civil penalties of $400,000 and $167,500, respectively.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on August 30, 2018, Grenda Group and Gregory Grenda permitted Gregory Grenda\u2019s father, Walter Grenda\u2014whom had been barred in 2015 by the SEC from associating with an investment advisor\u2014to associate with Grenda Group, including by meeting with clients in the firm\u2019s office. Additionally, the SEC alleged that Grenda Group and Gregory Grenda failed to disclose Walter Grenda\u2019s status as a barred investment advisor to their clients and made misleading statements to clients regarding Walter Grenda\u2019s bar.\n\nOn May 17, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York entered partial summary judgment on the SEC\u2019s claim under Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act. On December 10, 2021, a jury in the Western District of New York found in favor of the SEC on the remaining claims, finding that Gregory Grenda and Grenda Group violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, and that Gregory Grenda aided and abetted Grenda Group\u2019s violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by David Stoelting and former SEC senior counsel Barry P.

Prosperity, Investments & Lending, LLC, et al., No. 1:24-cv-00242-SCJ (N.D. Ga. Jan. 18, 2024)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Georgia Company and Organizer with Engaging in a Ponzi Scheme and Affinity Fraud Targeting Nigerian-Americans\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission charged Loganville, Georgia resident Prosper E. Beyond Moore and the entity he controls, Prosperity Investments & Solutions, LLC (\u201cProsperity\u201d), with defrauding dozens of investors in the Nigerian-American community who shared Moore\u2019s religious background.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, between October 2021 and September 2022, Moore and Prosperity made unregistered offerings of securities and raised more than $1.4 million from over 60 individual investors\u2014many of whom were members of Moore\u2019s church or learned of Moore\u2019s offerings through shared religious affiliations\u2014by falsely touting Prosperity as an exclusive investing and lending platform with an elite team of experienced individuals that would provide investors with profits of up to 50% each month. The complaint, however, alleges that Moore, who had no prior experience working in the financial industry, was the only person making investment decisions, and Prosperity did not actually invest the majority of funds it received from investors. Instead, according to the SEC, Moore operated Prosperity as a Ponzi scheme and used money from new investors to make payments to existing investors and to pay his personal expenses, while generating phony account statements to create the illusion of profits.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, charges Moore and Prosperity with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Moore and Prosperity each consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions and authorizing the court to determine at a later date the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties that each defendant shall pay. Moore also consented to a permanent officer-and-director bar pursuant to Section 20(e) of the Securities Act and Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, and to an injunction that permanently bars Moore from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of securities, except in his personal account.\n\nInvestors should be aware that many fraudsters try to take advantage of the trust that having something in common creates, such as a common religion, nationality, or ethnicity, and may also use unregistered offerings to conduct investment scams. The SEC\u2019s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert with tips on how investors should be wary of promises of high investment returns with little or no risk and avoid investment decisions based solely on common ties with someone recommending or selling the investment.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was part of the Atlanta Regional Office\u2019s Atlanta Area Affinity Fraud Initiative and was conducted by enforcement staff in the Atlanta Regional Office. The investigation was led by Deepthy Kishore and Kyle Bradley and supervised by Natalie Brunson and Justin Jeffries. The litigation will be led by Kristin Murnahan and supervised by M.

The complaint alleged that while offering Medsis securities, Cabrera and Hess made multiple material misrepresentations and misleading statements about Medsis to investors concerning the existence and value of contracts with customers, existing and expected revenue, and business operations. The complaint also alleged that Cabrera and Hess misrepresented to investors their personal use of investor funds.\n\nThe District Court entered final judgment after Medsis International defaulted in the action. In addition to ordering the financial remedies, the final judgment permanently enjoins Medsis from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the securities offering registration requirements of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. Medsis has been ordered to pay disgorgement of $11,842,015, prejudgment interest of $2,913,045, and a civil penalty of $1,116,140.\n\nThe District Court entered final judgment against Cabrera on March 9, 2023, as part of a settlement in which Cabrera agreed to pay disgorgement of $536,895, prejudgment interest of $52,816, and a civil penalty of $536,895, and to be enjoined from future violations of the securities laws and from offering and selling securities to others. The court entered final judgment against Paul Hess, on December 19, 2022, as part of a settlement in which Hess agreed to pay disgorgement of $527,000, prejudgment interest of $109,205, and a civil penalty of $207,183, and to be enjoined from future violations of the securities laws and from offering and selling securities to others.\n\nThe SEC's case was handled by Peter Bryan Moores, Marc Jones, and Kevin Currid of the Boston Regional Office.\n\n\n\tFinal Judgment - Medsis International, Inc.\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Medsis International, Inc.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Schottenstein also allegedly received information and traded ahead of the February 2018 announcement of a merger agreement between Albertsons Companies, Inc. and Rite Aid. According to the complaint, Schottenstein obtained the information from a cousin who served on the board of directors of both DSW and the company that had attempted to acquire Aphria, and whose family owned a private business that was involved in the Rite Aid transaction. In addition to trading for his own personal gain, the complaint alleges that Schottenstein tipped two friends who traded ahead of these announcements.\u00a0\n\nSchottenstein consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder and orders him to pay disgorgement of $536,752.90 and prejudgment interest of $67,933.16, which is deemed satisfied by the order of forfeiture in the parallel criminal case against him, United States v. David Schottenstein, Case No. 1:22-cr-10005-DPW (D. Mass.). Schottenstein pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud in the parallel case in February 2022 and in March 2023 was sentenced to one year and one day in prison, five years of supervised release, and ordered to forfeit $634,893.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case was handled by Megan Bergstrom and Michele T.

Giguiere, et al., No. 1:21-cv-05923 (S.D.N.Y. filed July 9, 2021)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against California Man for Insider Trading\n\n\n\nOn December 28, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against defendant Gannon Giguiere, whom the SEC previously charged with insider trading in advance of an announcement by Long Blockchain Company (formerly known as Long Island Iced Tea Co.) that it was going to \u201cpivot\u201d from its existing beverage business to blockchain technology, which caused the company\u2019s stock price to soar.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint was filed on July 9, 2021, in federal district court in the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleged that Giguiere purchased 35,000 shares of Long Blockchain stock within hours of receiving confidential information about Long Blockchain from his friend and co-defendant Oliver-Barret Lindsay, who had been tipped by co-defendant Eric Watson, who had signed a confidentiality agreement not to disclose Long Blockchain\u2019s business plans. According to the complaint, the company\u2019s stock price skyrocketed after a press release was issued announcing its shift to blockchain technology. The complaint further alleged that within two hours of the announcement, Giguiere sold his shares for over $160,000 in illicit profits.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Giguiere consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $325,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation has been conducted by Lindsay S. Moilanen, Mark R. Sylvester, Diego Brucculeri, and Sheldon L. Pollock, and the litigation is being led by Ms. Moilanen, Chevon Walker, and Mary Kay Dunning.

Mass. filed December 2, 2021)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgment Against Individual for Participating in Fraudulent Microcap Scheme\n\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced a judgment against an individual charged with participating in a fraudulent scheme involving unlawful microcap stock sales at the expense of unsuspecting retail investors. Among other things, the final judgment against Amar Bahadoorsingh, last of Canada, ordered him to pay $466,619.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that, from 2016 through at least October 2020, Bahadoorsingh and Canadian resident Vincenzo Carnovale secretly gained control of thinly traded microcap companies, hired stock promoters to create demand for their stock, and generated substantial illicit profits by selling the stock to unsuspecting investors. Bahadoorsingh and Carnovale allegedly hid the fact that they controlled the securities of publicly traded companies. They allegedly misled investors, brokers, and transfer agents (companies that maintain records of stock ownership) in order to convince these parties that the defendants' stock shares were eligible for trading in the public markets, when in fact their stock was not appropriately registered for sale with the SEC. They also allegedly caused the microcap companies to make materially false and misleading statements in their publicly filed financial statements and reports. Additionally, Bahadoorsingh allegedly fabricated documents that he provided to brokers and transfer agents in order to avoid due diligence procedures those parties had in place to comply with the securities laws.\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the federal district court in Boston, Massachusetts entered a final judgment by default against Bahadoorsingh, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act. The Court also imposed a penny stock bar on Bahadoorsingh and ordered him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains of $231,020, $28,416 in prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil penalty of $207,183.\n\nOn June 30, 2022, Bahadoorsingh was ordered in a separate SEC action to pay over $700,000 for his alleged participation in a fraudulent scheme to sell shares of microcap company Aureus Inc.\n\nThe SEC's ongoing case against defendant Vincenzo Carnovale is being handled by David J.

Investors were allegedly told that the distribution payments were paid exclusively with monies generated by GPB Capital\u2019s portfolio companies, but GPB Capital actually used investor money to pay portions of the annualized distribution payments.\u00a0 To perpetuate the deception, GPB Capital allegedly manipulated the financial statements to give the false appearance that the funds\u2019 income was closer to generating sufficient income to cover the distribution payments than it actually was. GPB Capital also allegedly violated the whistleblower provisions of the securities laws by including language in termination and separation agreements that impeded individuals from coming forward to the SEC, and by retaliating against a known whistleblower.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal court for the Eastern District of New York, charged Gentile, Schneider, GPB Capital, Ascendant Alternative Strategies, and Ascendant Capital with violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), and Jeffrey Lash with aiding and abetting certain of those violations.\u00a0 The complaint also charged GPB Capital and Gentile with violating the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d) and charged GPB Capital with violating the registration and whistleblower provisions of the Exchange Act and the Advisers Act\u2019s custody and compliance rules.\u00a0 The complaint sought disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and penalties.\n\nOn February 12, 2021, the Court appointed a monitor, Joseph T. Gardemal III, to oversee GPB Capital.\u00a0 On June 13, 2022, the SEC moved to convert the monitorship into a receivership because of GPB\u2019s alleged breach of the monitor order.\u00a0 On June 7, 2023, the Court entered a partial judgment against Lash by consent in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions. \u00a0On December 7, 2023, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s motion, and on December 8, 2023, the Court appointed Mr. Gardemal as receiver over GPB Capital and numerous affiliated entities.\u00a0 Pursuant to the terms of the order, within 45 days, the receiver shall provide the Court an accounting of receivership assets and propose a plan to distribute assets to investors.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation is being led by David Stoelting, Neal Jacobson, Kristin M. Pauley, Lindsay S. Moilanen, and Alistaire Bambach, and is being supervised by Sheldon L.

Andrew M. Komarow, No. 3:23-cv-01599 (D. Conn. filed December 8, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Connecticut Resident with Fraudulent \"Free-Riding\" Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against Andrew M. Komarow of Avon, Connecticut. The SEC\u2019s complaint charges Komarow with conducting a fraudulent \"free-riding\" scheme in which he attempted to profit by purchasing and selling securities without paying for them.\n\nThe complaint alleges that, from October 2022 to January 2023, Komarow engaged in a pattern of making unfunded electronic transfers of money from various bank accounts to at least ten accounts at four broker-dealers, knowing that he did not have sufficient funds in the bank accounts to cover the transfers. The complaint further alleges that Komarow immediately began trading securities in the brokerage accounts using funds that the brokerage firms made temporarily available while the fraudulent transfers were pending. When those transfers did not materialize, the brokerage firms were left with trading losses. According to the complaint, Komarow made false deposits totaling over $6.9 million. Komarow\u2019s trading was largely unprofitable: he removed at least $615,031 from the accounts but left the brokerage firms with losses totaling over $3 million, avoiding having to make good the losses himself.\n\nKomarow, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, consented to the entry of a partial judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The partial judgment also bars Komarow from opening any brokerage account without first providing the brokerage firm with a copy of the SEC's complaint and final judgment in this matter and prohibits him from placing any securities trades without having settled cash in the account equal to or greater than the amount of the trades. The partial judgment leaves to a later decision by the court whether to order disgorgement of Komarow\u2019s ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil monetary penalty. The partial judgment also orders that Komarow will be barred from serving as an officer or director of any public company for a period of time to be determined later by the court. Komarow\u2019s settlement offer is subject to approval by the court.\n\nThe SEC's case was handled by by Cassandra Arriaza, David Fox, John McCann, Kathleen Shields, and Celia Moore\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

CanaFarma Hemp Products Corp., et al., No. 1:21-cv-8211 (S.D.N.Y. filed Oct. 5, 2021, amended complaint filed Nov. 28, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgments Against Former Hemp Company Executives for Fraudulent Offerings\n\n\n\nOn December 1, 2023, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered consent judgments against Frank Barone and Kirill Chumenko, both former Senior Vice Presidents of Sales & Marketing at CanaFarma Hemp Products Corp. (\u201cCanaFarma\u201d), in connection with an approximately $15 million offering fraud. The SEC previously charged CanaFarma, a Canadian start-up hemp company with offices in Vancouver and New York, and its two co-founders, Vitaly Fargesen and Igor Palatnik, in connection with the same scheme.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s amended complaint, filed on November 28, 2023, alleges that, in 2019 and 2020, Barone and Chumenko, along with CanaFarma, Fargesen, and Palatnik, raised millions of dollars from investors. While raising these funds, Fargesen and Palatnik made misrepresentations to investors, including claims that CanaFarma was a fully integrated company that was processing hemp from its own farm when in fact it had not processed any of this hemp and its products used hemp supplied by third parties. The amended complaint alleges that Barone and Chumenko, at the direction of Fargesen, made unsupported changes to CanaFarma\u2019s financial model in order to disguise an expected series of payments to Fargesen and Palatnik. Additionally, the amended complaint alleges that, Fargesen and Palatnik\u2014in some instances with the assistance of Barone and Chumenko\u2014misappropriated at least $4 million and used the funds either for their personal use or for purposes unrelated to CanaFarma.\n\nIn addition to the previously announced charges against CanaFarma, Fargesen, and Palatnik, the amended complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Barone and Chumenko with violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.\n\nThe judgments against Barone and Chumenko permanently enjoin them from violating Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. The judgments also bar each of Barone and Chumenko from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in penny stock offerings, and order each to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The length of the bars and the amounts of the monetary remedies will be determined by the Court upon motion of the SEC at a later date.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by John Lehmann and Lee A. Greenwood, and was supervised by Thomas P. Smith, Jr. The litigation is being handled by Mr. Lehmann, Lindsay Moilanen, and Russell Feldman.

(\u201cCodeSmart\u201d). The SEC alleged that Wexler and others sought to flood the market with CodeSmart shares and engaged in a promotional campaign to artificially inflate the price of the stock. The SEC further alleged that Wexler personally dumped his CodeSmart shares on the market while working with two brokers who were at the same time purchasing CodeSmart stock in the accounts of their clients. In connection with this scheme, Wexler allegedly profited over $2 million.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged Wexler with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. On December 22, 2022, the Court entered a partial judgment against Wexler by consent in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions and agreed to a penny stock bar and officer-and-director bar. On December 4, 2023, the Court entered a final judgment against Wexler by consent in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions. He agreed to disgorge $2,218,599 in ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest thereon, the payment of which was deemed satisfied by the restitution order in the parallel criminal proceeding, United States v.

(\u201cCool Holdings\u201d), for their roles in a scheme involving false statements and omissions of material information in filings with the Commission, as well as a fraudulent pump-and-dump of Cool Holdings\u2019 stock. Entry of the final judgments against Diaz and Rezk concludes this litigation.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on January 6, 2023, from March 2018 through June 2019, Cool Holdings made false statements and omitted material information in SEC filings, including about a critical business relationship, in each of its quarterly and annual SEC filings, all signed by Diaz, Cool Holdings\u2019 CEO.\u00a0 Cool Holdings also filed false and misleading registration statements that were all signed by Diaz, Rezk, Cool Holdings\u2019 chief marketing officer, and Andrew DeFrancesco, Cool Holdings\u2019 Chairman of the Board.\u00a0 In addition, in the second half of 2018, Diaz and Rezk assisted DeFrancesco in conducting a pump-and-dump of Cool Holdings\u2019 stock.\u00a0\n\nBoth Diaz and Rezk consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\u00a0 The final judgments also ordered each to pay a civil money penalty of $223,229 and barred each from serving as an officer or director of a public company.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe SEC's litigation was conducted by David Stoelting, Mao Yu Lin, and Melissa Coppola of the New York Regional Office; Jason Schall and Danielle Srour of the Home Office; and Katherine Bromberg of the Boston Regional Office.

Dupont et al., No. 1:23-cv-05565 (S.D.N.Y. filed June 29, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgments Against Three Defendants for Insider Trading Prior to Pharmaceutical Merger\n\n\n\nOn November 27, 2023, the Honorable Vincent Marrero of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered judgments by consent against defendants Joseph M. Dupont and Stanley Kaplan, who were each charged with insider trading in the securities of Portola Pharmaceuticals Inc. Previously, on August 9, 2023, Judge Marrero entered a consent judgment against defendant Jarett G. Mendoza, who was also charged with insider trading Portola securities.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on June 29, 2023, alleges that Dupont was a vice president at Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. when he knowingly or recklessly tipped confidential information to a close friend about an anticipated May 2020 announcement of a tender offer by Alexion to acquire Portola. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, the close friend traded on that information and then passed the information to Kaplan and Mendoza, who also profitably traded. On the day of the acquisition announcement, Portola\u2019s stock price increased more than 130 percent.\n\nOn September 15, 2023, and September 19, 2023, respectively, Dupont and Kaplan pled guilty to federal criminal charges for securities fraud in a parallel criminal action before the District Court for the Southern District of New York in United States v. Joseph Dupont et al., 23-cr-00320. Previously, on June 28, 2023, Mendoza pled guilty to securities fraud and related charges in United States v. Jarett Mendoza, 23-cr-00316.\n\nDupont, Kaplan, and Mendoza each consented to judgments enjoining them from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. In addition, each was barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The district court will determine monetary remedies, if any, against these defendants at a later date. The SEC\u2019s litigation is continuing as to the remaining defendants.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Margaret Spillane, Matthew Lambert, and Alison Conn of the New York Regional Office under the supervision of Thomas P. Smith, Jr. The litigation is being led by Ms. Spillane.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

SAExploration Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 20-CV-08423 (S.D.N.Y. filed Oct. 8, 2020)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Former Executive For His Role in $100 Million Accounting Fraud\n\n\n\nOn November 15, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered the final judgment against Brian A. Beatty for his role in a multi-year accounting fraud that occurred while he was CEO and COO of Houston-based seismic data company SAExploration Holdings, Inc. (SAE). The SEC\u2019s amended complaint alleges that Beatty and three other former SAE executives falsely inflated the revenue of SAE by approximately $100 million and concealed their theft of millions of dollars from the company.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s amended complaint, Beatty and his co-defendants caused SAE to file materially false and misleading public statements after SAE entered into a series of seismic data acquisition contracts totaling approximately $140 million with a purportedly unrelated Alaska-based company that was, in fact, controlled by two of his co-defendants. The amended complaint alleges that SAE improperly recorded approximately $100 million in revenue in light of the Alaskan company\u2019s inability to pay and the SAE executives\u2019 control of the company. As also alleged, Beatty and his co-defendants misappropriated $12 million from SAE and routed approximately half of those funds back to SAE to create the false impression that the related Alaskan company was actually paying SAE for seismic data. The co-defendants allegedly kept the remainder of the misappropriated funds for themselves.\n\nWithout denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Beatty consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14 thereunder; and Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d). The final judgment also orders Beatty to pay $219,940 in disgorgement plus $41,763 in prejudgment interest, for a total of $261,703. Beatty was also ordered to reimburse SAE $441,995 pursuant to Section 304(a) of the SOX.\n\nThe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final consent judgment against SAE on December 17, 2020.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ongoing litigation against other defendants is being conducted by Peter Lallas, Dean Conway, and Yael Berger, and supervised by James Connor.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\tAmended SEC Complaint\n\tFinal Judgment - Brian A.

Vern A. Breland, No. 3:22-cv-01467 (W.D. La. filed June 2, 2022)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Former Mayor in Municipal Bond Offering Scheme\n\n\n\nOn November 6, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana entered a final judgment by consent against defendant Vern A. Breland for his involvement in two fraudulent municipal bond offerings. \u00a0On August 2, 2022, the Court had entered a final judgment in a related case against defendants Aaron B. Fletcher and Twin Spires Financial LLC for their involvement with Breland in the same fraudulent bond offerings.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s June 2, 2022 complaints, in 2017 and 2018 the town of Sterlington, Louisiana issued two revenue bonds to finance the development of a water system and improvements to its existing sewer system. \u00a0As required by state law, Sterlington applied to the Louisiana State Bond Commission (SBC) for approval of the two offerings. \u00a0The SEC alleged that Sterlington submitted false financial projections, created by Fletcher and Twin Spires, with then-Mayor Breland\u2019s active participation and approval, substantially overstating the number of historical and projected sewer customers in order to mislead the SBC as to the town\u2019s ability to cover the debt service for the proposed bonds. \u00a0The SEC alleged the Town and Breland did not disclose to bond investors that SBC approval of the bonds was based on the false projections or that Breland had directed the misuse of more than $3 million from earlier bond offerings intended for sewer system updates to instead pay for sports complex improvements, town legal fees, and payroll.\n\nBreland, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to the entry of the final judgment, which enjoined him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, enjoined him from participating in future offerings of municipal securities and ordered him to pay a $35,000 civil penalty. \u00a0\n\nRobbie L. Mayer and Creighton Papier of the SEC\u2019s Public Finance Abuse Unit conducted the investigation under the supervision of Peter J. Diskin and Deputy Unit Chief Rebecca J. Olsen.\u00a0 The litigation against Breland was conducted by William Hicks and Graham Loomis of the SEC\u2019s Atlanta Regional Office.\u00a0 The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the investigative Audit Staff of the Louisiana Legislative Auditor.\n\n\n\tFinal Judgment - Vern A.

Shustek and his wholly owned investment advisory firm, Vestin Mortgage LLC.\n\nThe SEC had charged Shustek and Vestin Mortgage LLC with violations of the federal securities laws in a complaint filed on July 29, 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada. The complaint alleges that since at least 2012, Shustek enriched himself and a REIT that he controlled, The Parking REIT, at the expense of two companies that he had founded earlier. According to the complaint, Shustek drained $29 million from the companies in order to funnel the money into The Parking REIT, and later directed the companies to enter into a series of money-losing transactions in which the same six buildings were repeatedly re-sold. The complaint also alleges that Shustek violated his fiduciary duties to the companies in two additional securities transactions.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Shustek and Vestin Mortgage LLC consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Shustek further consented to the entry of a final judgment: (1) ordering that he pay a $300,000 civil penalty; (2) for five years following entry of the judgment, prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of any public company; and (3) for five years following entry of the judgment, enjoining him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security provided, however, that such injunction shall not prevent him from purchasing or selling securities for his own personal account.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by Ellen Chen, John Han, Ruth Hawley, Marc Katz, Sheila O\u2019Callaghan, and David Zhou, and was supervised by Susan LaMarca and Jason H.

The entry of the consent judgments resolves all claims as to Rio Tinto and Albanese arising out of the SEC\u2019s October 17, 2017 complaint, which alleged, among other things, that certain of Rio Tinto\u2019s public filings contained misleading statements about the value of its Mozambican coal assets.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC\u2019s complaint, Rio Tinto consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently restraining and enjoining it from violating Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-16 thereunder, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $28 million, and requiring it to retain an independent consultant to review and evaluate its compliance with accounting standards and to cooperate in the SEC\u2019s ongoing litigation against Rio Tinto\u2019s former CFO Guy Elliott. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC\u2019s complaint, Thomas Albanese consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently restraining and enjoining him from violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, requiring him to cooperate in the SEC\u2019s ongoing litigation, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by Gregory Miller, Dean Conway, Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez, Emily Parise, and John Timmer, and supervised by Melissa Armstrong.

Appelbaum, a former registered representative of Aegis Capital Corporation.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint was filed on July 28, 2022.\u00a0 According to the complaint, Appelbaum violated the customer-specific suitability requirements applicable to broker-dealers by making unsuitable recommendations of certain variable interest rate structured products, commonly referred to as \u201csteepeners,\u201d to seven retail customers.\u00a0 The complaint alleges that the recommendations were unsuitable because the customers had \u201cmoderate\u201d risk tolerances and an unwillingness to lose their entire invested principal and, in many cases, also had an investment time horizon inconsistent with the securities.\u00a0 In addition, the complaint alleges that Appelbaum made false and misleading statements to some of the customers to prevent them from closing their accounts and engaged in unauthorized trading.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Appelbaum consented to entry of the final judgment, which provides for permanent injunctive relief under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.\u00a0 The final judgment also orders Appelbaum to pay a civil monetary penalty of $50,000 and disgorgement of $42,000 plus prejudgment interest of $5,500.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was led by James Connor and Eugene Hansen.\n\nFinal Judgment\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Marguerite Cassandra Toroian and Bell Rock Capital, LLC, No. 22-cv-715 (E.D. Pa. filed Feb. 25, 2022)\n\n\nSEC Settles Case Against Investment Adviser and its Principal Alleged to Have Engaged in a Fraudulent \u201cCherry-Picking\u201d Scheme\n\u00a0\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has reached settlements in its case against Defendant Bell Rock Capital, LLC, and its principal, Defendant M. Cassandra Toroian, for operating a multi-year \u201ccherry-picking\u201d scheme that defrauded Bell Rock clients. \u00a0As described in more detail below, among other things, Defendants agreed to pay disgorgement of $883,597, prejudgment interest of $185,451, and combined civil penalties of $440,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that, from at least January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2015, Toroian defrauded Bell Rock clients through a cherry-picking scheme. \u00a0Specifically, the SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that Toroian placed trades through a master trading account and disproportionately allocated profitable trades to accounts belonging to herself and her family members, and disproportionately allocated unprofitable trades to many of Bell Rock\u2019s clients. The complaint further alleged that Toroian made material misrepresentations to clients in Bell Rock\u2019s Form ADV and other communications, including, for instance, that Bell Rock and its associated persons would always act in their clients\u2019 best interest and not put their interests before the interests of clients. The complaint also alleged that Bell Rock failed to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent cherry picking in violation of Section 206(4) the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d) and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder, and that Toroian aided and abetted Bell Rock\u2019s failure. \u00a0\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Toroian has agreed to the entry of a final judgment: \u00a0(i) that permanently restrains and enjoins her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, and from aiding and abetting an investment adviser\u2019s violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder; (ii) ordering her to pay disgorgement of $883,597, plus prejudgment interest of $185,451; and (iii) ordering her to pay a penalty of $220,000. \u00a0Without admitting or denying the allegations, Bell Rock has agreed to the entry of a final judgment: (i) that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder; and (ii) ordering it to pay a penalty of $220,000. \u00a0The settlements are subject to court approval.\n\nThe litigation was handled by Christopher R. Kelly, Spencer Willig, and Kara F. Sweet and was supervised by Gregory R. Bockin of the SEC\u2019s Philadelphia Regional Office. \u00a0The SEC\u2019s investigation that led to this action was conducted by Han Nguyen and Julia C. Green of the SEC\u2019s Market Abuse Unit, with assistance from John Rymas in the Market Abuse Unit\u2019s Analysis and Detection Center and Raymond Wolff and Stuart Jackson in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00a0Joseph G.

Premium Point Investments LP et al., Civil Action No. 1:18-cv-04145 (S.D.N.Y. filed Nov. 7, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgment Against Former Hedge Fund Trader Related to Hedge Fund Valuation Scheme\n\n\n\nOn November 7, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final consent judgment against Jeremy Shor, a trader for a private fund advised by now-defunct New York-based investment adviser Premium Point Investments LP, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Premium Point engaged in a fraudulent valuation scheme that resulted in the inflation of the value of private funds Premium Point advised by hundreds of millions of dollars from at least September 2015 through March 2016. The scheme relied on a secret deal where in exchange for sending trades to a broker-dealer, Premium Point received inflated broker quotes for mortgage-backed securities, as well as the use of \u201cimputed\u201d mid-point valuations, which were applied in a manner that further inflated the value of securities. This practice boosted the value of many of Premium Point\u2019s holdings and further exaggerated returns in order to conceal poor fund performance and attract and retain investors.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged Shor with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder and Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8(a)(2) thereunder.\n\nThe SEC previously charged Premium Point, along with Shor, Premium Point\u2019s CEO and chief investment officer Anilesh Ahuja, and a Premium Point portfolio manager Amin Majidi, with fraud on May 9, 2018, later amending its complaint to add Premium Point trader Ashish Dole as a defendant. On September 20, 2022, the SEC obtained final judgments on consent enjoining Premium Point and Ahuja from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering Ahuja to pay a civil penalty. The SEC obtained final judgments on consent enjoining Majidi and Dole from violating the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities law on April 11, 2023.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation is led by Assistant Regional Directors Lee Greenwood and Joshua Brodsky and New York Regional Office Co-Regional Trial Counsel Preethi Krishnamurthy. The matter was investigated by the Division of Enforcement\u2019s Complex Financial Instruments and Asset Management Units, and is supervised by Osman Nawaz, Chief of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit.\n\n\n\tFinal Judgment - Jeremy Shor\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Jeremy Shor\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Julie Anne Darrah, et al., No. 2:23-cv-008843-CAS-AGR (C.D. Cal., filed Oct. 20, 2023)\u00a0\n\nSEC Obtains Emergency Relief Freezing Assets of Investment Adviser Charged with Defrauding Elderly Clients\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed charges and obtained a consented-to asset freeze against a Santa Maria, California-based investment adviser, who allegedly defrauded her victim clients of over $2 million.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Julie Anne Darrah and her firm, Vivid Financial Management, Inc. (\u201cVFM\u201d), misappropriated approximately $2.25 million from at least nine clients who had hired Darrah and VFM to be their investment adviser. The complaint alleges that Darrah primarily targeted elderly female advisory clients, many of whom had come to rely on Darrah for their financial well-being, including one client who lives in a memory care facility. The complaint states that Darrah gained control of her victim\u2019s assets by becoming the trustee of their trusts, using standing letters of authorization to transfer funds from their brokerage accounts to their bank accounts, becoming the signatory on their bank accounts, and/or obtaining power of attorney over their property and accounts. According to the complaint, Darrah transferred her victims\u2019 money to her personal bank accounts, where she commingled the funds with her own money that she used to buy and improve real properties, pay her personal expenses, buy luxury vehicles, and buy and operate restaurant businesses at a loss. The complaint further alleges that Darrah concealed her scheme by, among other things, changing client account mailing addresses to her own address, falsely disclosing that she was not acting as the trustee for any clients, and having a client initial two backdated promissory notes that Darrah provided to the SEC in response to its subpoenas.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on October 20, 2023, charges Darrah and VFM with violating Section 10(b) and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933; and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the \u201cAdvisers Act\u201d). It also charges VFM with violating Section 206(4) and Rules 206(4)-2 and 206(4)-7 of the Advisers Act, and it charges Darrah with aiding and abetting VFM\u2019s primary violations of those provisions. The complaint seeks disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, monetary penalties, and permanent and conduct-based injunctions. Darrah agreed to the entry of a preliminary injunction against her as well as an order freezing assets, requiring an accounting, prohibiting the destruction of documents, and granting expedited discovery, which the district court entered on October 20, 2023.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ongoing investigation is being conducted by staff in the SEC\u2019s Los Angeles Regional Office and Jonathon Grobelski of the SEC\u2019s Chicago Regional Office and is supervised by Robert Conrrad.

Cal. filed Dec. 21, 2022)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgment Against Issuer and CEO for Unregistered Crypto Asset Securities Offering\n\n\n\nOn October 18, 2023, the Honorable Charles R. Breyer of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California entered default judgment against Thor Technologies, Inc. and its CEO and co-founder David Chin for conducting a $2.6 million unregistered offering of crypto asset securities.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on December 21, 2022, against Thor and Chin, alleges that between March and May 2018, the defendants offered and sold crypto assets designated as \u201cThor Tokens\u201d to the general public for the purpose of funding Thor\u2019s business, which was to develop a software platform for \u201cgig\u201d economy workers and companies. As alleged, Thor and Chin marketed the Thor Tokens as an investment opportunity by promoting the potential increase in value of the tokens and claiming that the tokens would be made available on crypto asset trading platforms. According to the complaint, at the time of the offering, no development work had yet occurred on the Thor platform, and there was no other place to use Thor Tokens. The complaint further alleges that the offers and sales of Thor Tokens, which raised approximately $2.6 million in cash and crypto assets from investors, were not registered with the SEC and did not qualify for any exemption from registration.\n\nThe court granted default judgment for the SEC on all charges. The court permanently enjoined Thor and Chin from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and from participating in any crypto asset securities offering. The court also ordered Thor to pay disgorgement of $744,555 with prejudgment interest of $158,638.06 and ordered Thor and Chin to each pay penalties of $150,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Ruth L. Hawley and Erin E. Wilk and supervised by Jeremy E. Pendrey and Monique C. Winkler of the SEC\u2019s San Francisco Regional Office. The SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by Marc Katz, Ms. Hawley, and Ms. Wilk.\n\n\n\tFinal Judgment\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

The SEC\u2019s complaint further alleges that Rubin traded the Array stock options prior to the announcement of the acquisition, and as a result made illegal profits of $90,458.\n\nRubin has consented to the entry of a judgment, subject to court approval, which would permanently enjoin him from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, order him to pay disgorgement in the amount of $90,458 plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $16,914, and order him to pay a civil penalty in an amount to be determined by the court at a later date.\n\nIn a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Illinois announced criminal charges against Rubin.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by J.

Frederick L. Sharp et al., No. 1:21-cv-11276 (D. Mass. filed August 5, 2021)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Participant in International Microcap Fraud Schemes\n\n\n\nOn October 11, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against California resident Avtar S. Dhillon. The SEC charged Dhillon and eight other defendants for their roles in fraudulent schemes that collectively generated hundreds of millions of dollars from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors in the United States and around the world. Among other relief, the judgment orders Dhillon to pay more than $10 million.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Canadian resident Frederick Sharp masterminded a complex scheme from 2011 to 2019 in which he and his associates \u2013 Canadian residents Zhiying Yvonne Gasarch and Courtney Kelln \u2013 enabled control persons of microcap companies, whose stock was publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets, to conceal their control and ownership of huge amounts of the stock and then surreptitiously dump the stock into the U.S. markets, in violation of federal securities laws. The complaint alleges that one group of control persons, comprising Canadian residents Mike K. Veldhuis, Paul Sexton, and Jackson T. Friesen, frequently collaborated with Sharp to sell massive stock positions while hiding their control positions and stock promotional activities from the investing public. Dhillon, who chaired the boards of directors of four of the public companies whose stocks were fraudulently sold during the schemes, was allegedly complicit with this group of control persons, as well as with Canadian resident Graham R. Taylor. Dhillon allegedly reaped millions in illicit proceeds from those illegal sales. According to the complaint, Maryland resident William T. Kaitz worked as a promoter and allegedly touted stocks that Veldhuis, Sexton, and Friesen simultaneously planned to sell, while concealing their roles.\n\nDhillon has consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(d), and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 13d-2, and 16a-3 thereunder. Dhillon\u2019s judgment imposes a penny stock bar and orders him to pay disgorgement of $9,143,548 and prejudgment interest of $1,303,236, with an offset against his disgorgement amount for $1,493,500 Dhillon has agreed to pay to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts in the U.S. v. Dhillon criminal action.\u00a0\n\nThe court previously entered a judgment by default against Sharp that, among other relief, ordered him to pay more than $50 million, and judgments by consent against Taylor and Kaitz. The court entered judgments against Kelln and Veldhuis, in June 2023, that imposed injunctions and penny stock bars with any monetary relief to be determined by the court at a later date. The court entered a judgment against Sexton on September 12, 2023 in which Sexton agreed not to contest his liability with any injunctive and monetary relief to be determined by the court at a later date. On September 27, 2023, after a ten-day trial, a jury found Gasarch liable for violating Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder and Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act. The jury further found Friesen liable for violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) and 13d-1 thereunder and Sections 5(a) and (c) and 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act.\u00a0\n\nThe matter was handled by Kathleen Shields, David London, Alfred Day, and Nita Klunder of the Boston Regional Office.\n\n\n\tSEC Judgment\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Fla. filed September 29, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Agent Funds and Principals with Fraud and Registration Violations; Settles with Other Agent Funds to Registration Violations\n\n\n\nLast week the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Pisces Income Fund, LLC, Pisces Income Fund Parallel, LLC, and their principals Shannon Westhead and Alec Vagnozzi; Capricorn Income Fund I, LLC, Capricorn Income Fund I Parallel, LLC, and their principal Albert Vagnozzi; Merchant Services Income Fund, LLC, Merchant Services Income Fund Parallel, LLC, and their principal Michael Tierney alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection with their participation in the more than $500 million unregistered and fraudulent securities offering by Complete Business Solutions Group, d/b/a Par Funding (\u201cCBSG\u201d). These entities, acting as agent funds of CBSG, and individuals raised more than $65 million from approximately 260 investors nationwide for the purpose of investing in CBSG in violation of the antifraud, securities registration, and broker-dealer registration provisions of the securities laws.\n\nIn addition to participating in CBSG\u2019s unregistered offering, the SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that when soliciting investors, the individual defendants made material misrepresentations and omitted material information concerning CBSG\u2019s regulatory history and the criminal background of CBSG\u2019s principal. The SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges Westhead, Alec Vagnozzi, Albert Vagnozzi, and Tierney with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Exchange Act Section 15(a). The complaint also alleges all defendants violated the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act. The SEC\u2019s complaint seeks permanent injunctions and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest against all defendants, as well as civil money penalties against Westhead, Alec Vagnozzi, Albert Vagnozzi, and Tierney.\n\nThe SEC also filed a settled civil injunctive action against ABFP Income Fund 3, LLC; ABFP Income Fund 3 Parallel, LLC; ABFP Income Fund 4, LLC; ABFP Income Fund 4 Parallel, LLC; ABFP Income Fund 6, LLC; ABFP Income Fund 6 Parallel, LLC; ABFP Multi-Strategy Investment Fund, LP; ABFP Multi-Strategy Investment Fund 2, LP; and ABFP Income Fund Parallel, LLC based on their participation in CBSG\u2019s offerings. The ABFP Funds were formed at various points in 2019 by Dean Vagnozzi, whom the Commission charged in its initial CBSG action. Through the ABFP Funds, Dean Vagnozzi raised approximately $99 million from more than 570 investors. In this settled action, also filed in the Southern District of Florida, the ABFP Funds, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings, agreed to an order finding they violated the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act and injunctive relief as well as disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.\n\nThis is the fourth enforcement action related to the CBSG fraud. In July 2020, the SEC filed an emergency action against CBSG and obtained, among other relief, emergency orders freezing CBSG\u2019s assets and appointing a receiver over certain related entity defendants. See SEC vs. Complete Business Solutions Group Inc. d/b/a/ Par Funding et al., No. 9:20-Cv-81205 (S.D.FL Filed Jul 31, 2020). In June 2022, the SEC announced charges against registered investment adviser A.G. Morgan Financial Advisors, LLC in connection with the firm\u2019s unlawful participation in CBSG\u2019s fraudulent offering; and in July 2022, the SEC announced settled charges against Philadelphia attorney John W. Pauciulo in connection with his role in CBSG\u2019s offering.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Linda S. Schmidt and Crystal C. Ivory and supervised by Sean M.

Nano-x Imaging Ltd. and Ran Poliakine, No. 1:23-cv-8611 (S.D.N.Y filed September 29, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Diagnostic Imaging Company and its former CEO for misrepresenting the manufacturing costs of its flagship device. \n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against an Israel-based diagnostic imaging company, Nano-X Imaging Ltd. (\u201cNanox\u201d), and its former CEO, Ran Poliakine (\u201cPoliakine\u201d), for negligently misrepresenting the cost to manufacture the company\u2019s flagship imaging device, the Nanox.ARC. Nanox and Poliakine have agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s complaint alleges that from August 2020 to May 2021, Nanox and Poliakine claimed the company could mass-produce the Nanox.ARC \u2013 a purported low-cost alternative to existing X-ray devices \u2013 for $8,000 to $12,000 per unit. According to the SEC, Poliakine ignored higher alternative cost estimates provided by company executives, including engineering executives, while touting the lower manufacturing costs. The complaint alleges that Nanox included this misleading cost estimate in reports filed with the Commission prior to raising $165 million in an initial public offering. The company continued to include the estimate in subsequent financial filings, and Poliakine repeated this estimate in numerous earnings calls and media interviews.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Nanox with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, and Poliakine with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Nanox and Poliakine have consented to the entry of a final judgment that imposes permanent injunctions; orders Nanox and Poliakine to pay civil penalties of $650,000 and $150,000, respectively; and orders Poliakine to pay $266,836.39 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest. These settlements are subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Jillian Harris and Ayesha Ahmed of the SEC\u2019s Fort Worth Regional Office, under the supervision of Jim Etri and Eric Werner. The litigation will be led by Jason Rose and supervised by B. David Fraser.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Luther C. Speight, III and Luther Speight & Company, LLC, No. 1:23-cv-4384-AT (N.D. GA. filed Sept. 27, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Files Settled Fraud Charges Against New Orleans-Based Auditor and Its Principal\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced settled charges against New Orleans-based audit firm Luther Speight & Company, LLC (\u201cLSC\u201d) and its principal Luther C. Speight, III.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, LSC and Speight were hired in June 2019 by a Louisiana-based school board (\u201cSchool Board\u201d) to perform an audit of the School Board\u2019s fiscal year 2019 financial statements. The SEC alleged that, on January 2, 2020, LSC, through Speight, issued an auditor\u2019s report stating that it had conducted the audit of the School Board\u2019s fiscal year 2019 financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Audit Standards (\u201cGAAS\u201d). According to the SEC\u2019s allegations, this statement was false, as Speight and LSC did not comply with GAAS in many important and material respects, and the School Board\u2019s financial statements also contained various errors that had to be corrected. The SEC alleged that Speight and LSC knew, or should have known, that the School Board would use the auditor\u2019s report to sell bonds to investors. The SEC further alleged that the School Board unknowingly used LSC\u2019s auditor\u2019s report, with the false statement, to sell $120 million of bonds to an investor in March 2020.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, LSC and Speight agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. Speight also agreed to a conduct-based injunction which would prevent him from serving as the engagement manager, engagement partner, or engagement quality reviewer in connection with any audit of financial statements or audit report which Speight should reasonably expect to be submitted to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board\u2019s Electronic Municipal Market Access website (\u201cEMMA\u201d), and LSC agreed to a conduct-based injunction which would prevent it from participating in the audit of financial statements which LSC should reasonably expect to be submitted to EMMA. LSC and Speight also agreed to be held jointly and severally liable to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling of $12,826. LSC and Speight also consented to pay civil penalties of $20,000 and $10,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Robbie Mayer and Creighton Papier of the Enforcement Division\u2019s Public Finance Abuse Unit, with assistance from Kristin Murnahan of the SEC\u2019s Atlanta Regional Office and was supervised by Peter J. Diskin, Rebecca Olsen and LeeAnn Gaunt of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Marco A. Perez (aka Marc Perez), Pedro Perez, Jr. (aka Peter Perez), and Olivia Perez Durbin, No. 23-cv-08079 (C.D. Cal. filed September27, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Three Southern California Siblings with Insider Trading\n\n\n\nYesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against siblings Marco A. Perez (aka Marc), Pedro Perez, Jr. (aka Peter), and Olivia P. Durbin for insider trading before the April 2021 announcement of an offer by storage company United Rentals Inc. to acquire General Finance Corp. The three defendants, all of whom reside in Southern California, realized a combined total of $650,000 in illegal profits from their trading.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that Marco Perez, formerly a General Finance accounting manager, learned in late February 2021 of United Rentals\u2019 interest in acquiring General Finance. As alleged, Marco Perez then began purchasing General Finance shares and continued to do so as he learned about progress on the acquisition. According to the complaint, Marco Perez tipped Pedro Perez and Durbin and encouraged them to buy General Finance shares, including by telling Pedro Perez that he was \u201call in.\u201d As alleged, Pedro Perez and Durbin then bought General Finance shares as well. When United Rentals announced the acquisition, General Finance\u2019s share price increased from $12.17 to $18.95, and trading volume soared 19,000 percent. As alleged in the complaint, the defendants sold or tendered their shares and realized combined profits of $650,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal court in the Central District of California, charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. Without denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Marco Perez consented to a partial judgment, subject to court approval, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering that he pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty in amounts to be determined, and imposing a five-year officer and director bar. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC\u2019s complaint, Pedro Perez consented to a judgment, subject to court approval, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest of $141,251.79 and a civil penalty of $127,142.32, and imposing a five-year officer and director bar. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC\u2019s complaint, Durbin consented to a judgment permanently enjoining her from securities fraud and ordering her to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest of $38,638.28 and a civil penalty of $34,867.17.\n\nIn a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California today announced securities fraud charges against Marco Perez.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Roberto Tercero and supervised by Finola H.

Edward O'Donnell and Victor Bozzo, No. 23-civ-8543 (SDNY filed September 28, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Former Pareteum Executives with Accounting and Disclosure Fraud\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against the former Chief Financial Officer, Edward O'Donnell, and the former Chief Commercial Officer, Victor Bozzo, of New York-based telecommunications company Pareteum Corp. for engaging in fraudulent revenue recognition practices. The SEC also announced settled charges against Pareteum's former Controller, Stanley Stefanski, for his role in the scheme. Pareteum previously settled to accounting and disclosure fraud charges filed by the SEC in 2021 and filed for bankruptcy in 2022.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, from at least 2018 through mid-2019, Bozzo, O'Donnell, and Stefanski engaged in a fraudulent scheme to recognize revenue from Pareteum customers' non-binding purchase orders for SIM card services, despite knowing that the customers had not committed to paying for the services unless they were able to sell the services to downstream consumers. The SEC's complaint also alleges that, because of these executives' misconduct, Pareteum improperly recognized revenue for the purchase orders before the SIM cards were shipped to the customers. This improper revenue recognition scheme allowed Pareteum to materially overstate its revenue by $12 million - or 60 percent - for fiscal year 2018 and by $27 million - or 91 percent - for the first and second quarters of 2019 combined in its financial statements filed with the SEC.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Bozzo and O'Donnell with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charges O'Donnell with violating Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, as well as aiding and abetting Pareteum's violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement and prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer and director bars against Bozzo and O'Donnell, and also seeks to order O'Donnell to reimburse Pareteum certain compensation pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Separately, the SEC issued an order finding that Stefanski willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) and 13b2-2 thereunder; willfully aided and abetted and caused O'Donnell's and Pareteum's violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and willfully aided and abetted and caused Pareteum's violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. Stefanski agreed to settle the charges and to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of those provisions, to an officer and director bar, to be denied the privilege of appearing and practicing before the SEC as an accountant, and to be subject to future proceedings to determine any monetary relief.\n\nIn a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Bozzo and O'Donnell.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Megan Ryan under the supervision of Julia C. Green, Scott A. Thompson, and Nicholas P. Grippo of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be handled by Karen Klotz and Judson Mihok, under the supervision of Gregory R. Bockin.

Robert Del Prete., No. 23-CV-20452 (MAS) (DEA) (D.N.J. filed September 18, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgment Against Former SPAC Accounting Consultant Charged with Insider Trading\n\n\n\nOn September 25, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entered judgment against Robert Del Prete for engaging in insider trading when he purchased shares of HighCape Capital Acquisition Corp. (\"HighCape\"), a special purpose acquisition company, in advance the company's announcement that it would merge with Quantum-Si Incorporated (\"QSI\").\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that Del Prete, an accounting consultant to HighCape, was present at HighCape's board meetings on January 27 and February 17, 2021, at which the planned merger with QSI was discussed. The complaint alleges that Del Prete, who had agreed to keep HighCape's proprietary information confidential, bought shares of HighCape on February 17, 2021, less than an hour after attending the board meeting that day. The complaint further alleges that, within hours of HighCape's February 18, 2021, press release announcing the deal, Del Prete liquidated his position, realizing an approximate one-hundred percent profit of $60,170 from his illegal trading.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Del Prete consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and bars him from acting as an officer or director of a publicly traded company. Monetary remedies against Del Prete will be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the SEC.\n\nThe SEC's litigation is being handled by Ibrahim Sajalieu Bah of the New York Regional Office and is being supervised by Celeste Chase and Thomas P.

Adam E. Levin, No. 2:23-cv-08081 (filed Sept. 27, 2023, C.D. Cal.)\n\n\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission v. Sheldon Richard Bentley a/k/a Rick Bentley, No. 2:23-cv-02119-JDP (filed Sept. 27, 2023 E.D. Cal.).\n\n\n\nSEC Settles Actions Against Executives of Two Reg A Issuers for Involvement in Scheme To Fraudulently Promote Securities Offerings\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Hightimes Holding Corp. Executive Chairman Adam Levin and Cloudastructure, Inc. Chief Executive Officer Rick Bentley for their involvement in separate fraudulent schemes to promote securities offerings that Hightimes and Cloudastructure were conducting pursuant to Regulation A, which, if certain conditions are met, provides an exemption to the Securities Act's registration provisions. Levin and Bentley have agreed to settle the SEC charges.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaints, Levin and Bentley participated in the fraudulent promotions of their companies' securities by concealing payments to Jonathan William Mikula through middlemen acting on his behalf, and lavishly entertaining Mikula, in exchange for promotion by Mikula through Palm Beach Venture, a newsletter for which he served as an author and chief analyst. The complaint against Levin alleges that he participated in the fraudulent promotion of Hightimes' securities between at least April 2020 and August 2021. A separate complaint against Bentley alleges that he participated in the fraudulent promotion of Cloudastructure's securities between at least September 2020 and mid-2021. The charging documents further allege that Levin and Bentley made material misrepresentations and omissions to investors in connection with their offerings. According to the complaint filed against Levin, he also engaged in an offering of Hightimes' securities that was unregistered and not covered by a valid registration exemption between June 2020 and December 2022.\n\nThis is the second set of actions that the SEC has filed in connection with this fraudulent promotional scheme. In September 2022, the SEC filed a complaint against Mikula, a recidivist securities law violator, alleging that he promoted the securities of Reg A issuers, including Hightimes and Cloudastructure, without disclosing his receipt of compensation for the promotions. As alleged, Mikula promoted the securities through Palm Beach Venture and presented the recommendations as unbiased and not paid for, while he was secretly compensated in the form of cash and lavish entertainment expenses. The SEC litigation is continuing against Mikula, as well as his associate Christian Fernandez, who allegedly acted as a middleman for the promotional scheme.\n\nThe SEC's complaint against Levin charges him with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Levin agreed to the entry of a final judgment imposing a permanent injunction, a penalty of $111,614, and a 3-year bar from serving as an officer and director.\n\nThe SEC's complaint against Bentley charges him with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Bentley agreed to the entry of a final judgment imposing a permanent injunction, a penalty of $111,614, and a 5-year bar from serving as an officer and director.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Yolanda Ochoa and Sarah Nilson, with assistance from Charles Canter and Dora Zaldivar.

Cal. filed September 27, 2023)\n\nSEC Charges Private Real Estate Funds\u2019 Managers and Investment Adviser for Fraudulent and Unregistered Securities Offering\n\n\n\nThe SEC brought charges against defendants Charles Tralka, Thomas Braegelmann, Matthew Sullivan, Jordan Goodman, investment adviser Good Steward Capital Management, Inc. (\u201cGood Steward\u201d) and its owner Robert Barr, and relief defendants Secured Real Estate Income Fund I, LLC (\u201cIncome Fund\u201d) and Secured Real Estate Income Strategies, LLC (\u201cIncome Strategies\u201d) in connection with an alleged offering fraud that raised over $7.3 million from about 147 investors from April 2016 through March 2021.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that the funds\u2019 managing members Tralka and Braegelmann selected and managed the real estate investments, managing member Sullivan acted as investor relations, and managing member Goodman, a recidivist, drummed up potential investors through his radio programs.\u00a0 The complaint also alleges that Good Steward and Barr, though described as the funds\u2019 investment adviser, primarily served in an administrative capacity.\u00a0 The SEC further alleges that both funds\u2019 offering documents and marketing materials misled investors regarding: (1) the payment of reliable monthly distributions at an 8% annual rate; (2) Tralka and Braegelmann\u2019s purported 50+ years of real estate investing experience; and (3) that SEC-registered investment adviser Good Steward would make the funds\u2019 investment decisions.\u00a0 In addition, the SEC alleges that, although Income Strategies\u2019 offering circular stated that it would meet its $1 million investment threshold with investments from third parties, it in fact met this threshold through investments from related parties Income Fund and Good Steward and also failed to keep investor funds in escrow.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, which was filed in the Northern District of California, charges Tralka, Braegelmann, Sullivan, and Goodman with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d).\u00a0 The complaint also charges Tralka, Braegelmann, Sullivan, Good Steward, and Barr with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\u00a0 The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil penalties against Tralka, Braegelmann, Sullivan, Goodman, Good Steward, and Barr.\u00a0 The complaint also seeks conduct-based injunctions against Tralka, Braegelmann, Sullivan, Goodman, and Barr, and officer and director bars against Tralka, Braegelmann, Sullivan, and Barr.\u00a0 The complaint also seeks disgorgement plus prejudgment interest from relief defendants Income Fund and Income Strategies.\n\nGoodman, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, consented, pre-filing, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act; prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security in an unregistered offering by an issuer \u00a0(provided, however, that such injunction would not prevent Goodman from purchasing or selling securities for his own personal account); and ordering him to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil penalties, with the amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Tony Regenstreif and supervised by Victoria A.

Hyzon Motors and Two Former Executives for Misleading Investors\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced settled fraud charges against Hyzon Motors Inc., an upstate New York-based company that builds hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), for misleading investors about its business relationships and vehicle sales before and after a July 2021 merger with a publicly-traded special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. The SEC also charged Craig M. Knight, Hyzon's former CEO, and Max C.B. Holthausen, former managing director of Hyzon's European subsidiary, for their roles in the fraudulent scheme.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, Hyzon misrepresented the status of its business dealings with potential customers and suppliers to create the false appearance that significant sales transactions were imminent. The complaint alleges that Hyzon also falsely stated that it had delivered its first FCEV in July 2021, even going as far as posting a misleading video of the vehicle purportedly running on hydrogen, when the vehicle was not equipped to operate on hydrogen power. The complaint further alleges that Hyzon later falsely reported that it sold 87 FCEVs in 2021, when in fact it had not sold any vehicles that year. Knight allegedly was responsible for the false statements about Hyzon's customer and supplier relationships. Holthausen allegedly was responsible for Hyzon's false statements about delivery of its first FCEV and for Hyzon's false reporting of certain FCEV sales.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York, charges: Hyzon and Holthausen with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charges Knight with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint also charges defendants with violations or aiding and abetting violations of additional books and records, control, reporting, and proxy solicitation provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13a-15(a), and 14a-9 thereunder (Hyzon); Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 thereunder (Knight); and aiding and abetting Hyzon's violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder (Holthausen).\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hyzon, Knight, and Holthausen each consented to permanent injunctions and to pay\u00a0$25 million, $100,000, and $200,000, respectively, in civil penalties. Knight and Holthausen also agreed to prohibitions from serving as officers or directors of a publicly traded company for a period of five and ten years, respectively. The settlements are subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by David F. Benson, John T. Chisholm, and Anne C. Romero, with assistance from Sharan E.

Intrusion Inc., No. 4:23-cv-00859 (E.D. Tex. filed September 26, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Dallas Area Cybersecurity Company with Fraud\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint against Intrusion Inc. (\"Intrusion\") for making false and misleading statements in 2020 and 2021, primarily through its former CEO, regarding the company's purported success in marketing a cybersecurity product, the terms of multiple contracts, and the background and experience of its former CEO. Intrusion has agreed to settle the SEC's charges.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that from May 2020 through May 2021, Intrusion made materially false and misleading statements in press releases, earnings calls, interviews, and other public statements. As alleged in the complaint, Intrusion overstated its success in marketing Intrusion Shield, a new cybersecurity product, by falsely representing that most or nearly all beta-testing participants had converted to paying customers, when in fact less than half of such participants became paying customers. In addition, the SEC alleges that Intrusion misled investors about three customer relationships by omitting material information about the economic terms of one contract, prematurely claiming that a second contract had been executed, and falsely claiming that a third customer had signed a contract when it had not. Finally, the complaint alleges that Intrusion made misleading statements about the qualifications, experience, and accomplishments of its former CEO.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, charges Intrusion with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the current reporting and disclosure controls and procedures provisions of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-11 and 13a-15(a) thereunder. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions against Intrusion. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Intrusion has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that addresses all charges and relief sought by the SEC.

Phoenix Outsourced Development, LLC, Edger Solutions Management, LLC, Michael McLaughlin, Derek McLaughlin, Louis Peter Goff, Eric Fairbourn, Brian Hubbard, Nicholas Deluca, No. 2:23-civ-00663-DAO (U.S. District Court, District of Utah) filed September 25, 2023\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Two Utah Fund Managers and Their Principals with Securities Fraud\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against two Utah fund managers, Phoenix Outsourced Development and Edger Solutions Management, and their principals, including a securities law recidivist, for allegedly orchestrating a fraudulent high-yield Forex trading program through two investment funds resulting in approximately $2.1 million in investor losses.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, Michael McLaughlin, a securities law recidivist, and Derek McLaughlin created an investment fund called POD Solutions, LLC, managed by their entity, Phoenix Outsourced Development. Louis Peter Goff, Brian Hubbard, Eric Fairbourn, and Nicholas Deluca created a separate, but similar investment fund, Edger Solutions, LLC, managed by their entity, Edger Management Solutions. The SEC alleges the two fund managers and their principals failed to disclose to investors that their investments would be combined into a Forex trading account that was operated by a convicted felon and a securities fraud recidivist. The SEC's complaint also alleges that the defendants made numerous material misrepresentations to investors concerning fees, profit and loss calculations, and the historical performance of the funds. The SEC further alleges that the defendants fabricated monthly account statements and that Michael and Derek McLaughlin misappropriated investor funds.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, charges all defendants with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, each defendant consented to a permanent injunction from future violations of these antifraud provisions. Each individual defendant also consented to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating, directly or indirectly, including but not limited to, through any entity owned and controlled by him, in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, provided, however, that such injunction shall not prevent him from purchasing or selling securities for his own personal account, and agreed to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil penalties in the following amounts:\n\n\n\tMichael Mclaughlin: disgorgement of $116,940 plus prejudgment interest of $11,503, and a civil penalty of $207,182.\n\t\u00a0\n\tDerek McLaughlin: disgorgement of $108,433 plus prejudgment interest of $10,667, and a civil penalty of $75,000.\n\t\u00a0\n\tLouis Peter Goff: a civil penalty of $60,000.\n\t\u00a0\n\tBrian Hubbard, Eric Fairbourn, and Nicholas Deluca: civil penalties of $50,000 each.\n\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Jennifer Moore and Paul Feindt and was supervised by Tanya Beard and Tracy Combs of the Salt Lake Regional Office.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

MacWright and HCM have agreed to pay nearly two million dollars to settle the charges.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, alleges that from April 22, 2015 through June 30, 2022, MacWright, through HCM, used an omnibus or average price account to disproportionately allocate trades that had increased in value during the day they were executed to a preferred account. The complaint also alleges that MacWright disproportionately allocated trades that had decreased in value during the day they were executed to accounts held by other persons and entities, including accounts owned by MacWright, MacWright\u2019s family members, or entities he partially owned.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, MacWright and HCM have consented to the entry of final judgments that would: permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d), and permanently enjoin HCM from violating, and MacWright from aiding and abetting violations of, Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder; order MacWright to pay $1,118,718 in disgorgement, $253,903 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $400,000; and order HCM to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlements are subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by the SEC Enforcement Division\u2019s Market Abuse Unit members Jeffrey E.

Nathalia I. Burgos, Case No. 23-cv-61818 WPD (S.D. Fla filed September 22, 2023)\n\n\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission v. Steven A. Fernandez et. al., Case No. 23-cv-61816 (S.D. Fla filed September 22, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Additional Persons for Their Roles in a South Florida $196 Million Ponzi Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed actions against four individuals, Nathalia I. Burgos, Christian A. Cuesta, Steven A. Fernandez, and Monica M. O'Mealia, for their roles in the alleged $196 million securities fraud perpetrated by MJ Capital Funding, LLC. The SEC's complaints against Burgos, Cuesta, Fernandez, and O'Mealia were filed in federal district court in the Southern District of Florida.\n\nThe SEC previously charged MJ Capital and an affiliated company, MJ Taxes and More, Inc., and their principal officer, Johanna M. Garcia, on August 9, 2021, for allegedly perpetrating a fraudulent securities offering and Ponzi scheme. An amended complaint was filed by the SEC on February 22, 2022. MJ Capital and MJ Taxes are currently under a court-appointed receivership.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint against Burgos, the former vice president of MJ Capital, from at least December 2020 until August 2021, she solicited and raised at least $82,000 from 10 to 13 investors on behalf of MJ Capital and MJ Taxes. The complaint alleges that Burgos represented to investors that their funds would be used to make \"merchant cash advance\" loans to small businesses, and that in exchange, investors would receive monthly returns of 10% or more. In reality, as alleged in the complaint, MJ Capital was using new investor money to pay purported returns to existing investors in a classic Ponzi scheme fashion and company insiders were misappropriating and misusing investor funds. The complaint alleges that Burgos knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that her statements to investors were false because she had access to and control over MJ Capital and MJ Taxes' bank accounts and corporate credit card, which showed Ponzi-like payments and misappropriation. The complaint also alleges that Burgos personally misappropriated about $39,000 in investor funds.\n\nThe SEC's complaint against Cuesta, who was a former \"board member\" and sales agent of MJ Capital, alleges that from at least June 2020 until August 2021, Cuesta illegally acted as an unregistered broker while offering and selling MJ Capital and MJ Taxes' unregistered securities to the public. Specifically, as alleged, Cuesta and his team of more than 100 sales agents solicited and raised about $29.5 million from over 970 investors on behalf of MJ Capital and MJ Taxes. The complaint also alleges that Cuesta received about $1.96 million in commission payments from MJ Capital for these sales of securities, which were all paid out of investor money.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint against Fernandez and O'Mealia, who are husband and wife, from at least August 2020 through August 2021, they both illegally acted as unregistered brokers while offering and selling MJ Capital and MJ Taxes' unregistered securities to the public. The complaint alleges that Fernandez and O'Mealia personally, and through their team of sales agents, solicited and raised at least $19.4 million from over 800 investors, and together received $1.8 million in commission payments from MJ Capital, which were all paid out of investor funds.\n\nThe SEC charges Burgos with violating the antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Burgos violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC charges Cuesta, Fernandez and O'Mealia with violating the securities and broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Specifically, that they violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties against Burgos, Cuesta, Fernandez and O'Mealia.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Fernandez and O'Mealia have consented to a settlement, subject to court approval, under which they will be enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $755,017, and each a civil penalty of $75,000.\n\nThe SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Raynette R. Nicoleau and Julia D'Antonio in the Miami Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Fernando Torres, and Glenn S. Gordon. The SEC's litigation is being led by Stephanie Moot under the supervision of Teresa Verges.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\tSEC Complaint - Amended\n\tSEC Complaint - Nathalia I.

Darbie & Co., Inc., a New York City-based brokerage firm, in connection with its alleged failure to report suspicious activity related to transactions in tens of billions of shares of low-priced securities - or \"penny stocks\" - that were traded in over-the-counter markets.\n\nTo help detect potential securities law and money-laundering violations, broker-dealers are required to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) describing suspicious transactions taking place through their firms.\u00a0According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 12, 2022, from at least January 2018 to January 2020, J.H. Darbie failed to investigate and file SARs for numerous suspicious transactions, even when the transactions raised red flags recognized in J.H Darbie's written anti-money laundering policies and procedures and in regulatory guidance.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC's complaint, J.H. Darbie consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently restraining and enjoining it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-8 thereunder, and ordering the firm to pay a civil penalty of $125,000 and to retain an independent anti-money laundering compliance consultant.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was conducted by Christopher Colorado, Victor Suthammanont, and Suzanne Bettis and was supervised by Thomas P.

Jonathan Becker, No. 1:23-cv-08331 (S.D.N.Y. filed September 20, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Announces Additional Charges in Scheme to Trade Ahead of Pharma Tender Offer\n\n\n\nOn September 20, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed insider trading charges against Jonathan Becker of Weehawken, New Jersey for trading on inside information unlawfully communicated to him by his then friend and roommate.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Becker made approximately $266,000 from illegally trading in advance of the February 2021 announcement of a tender offer by Merck & Co., Inc. to acquire Pandion Therapeutics, Inc. The SEC's complaint alleges that Becker's then friend and roommate unlawfully communicated material nonpublic information about the impending acquisition to Becker after receiving a tip about the deal from his cousin, Seth Markin. As previously alleged in the SEC's July 25, 2022 complaint against Seth Markin and his friend Brandon Wong, Markin misappropriated confidential information about the planned tender offer from his then-romantic partner, who worked as an associate for a law firm representing Merck on the deal, and then traded on the material nonpublic information and tipped multiple other individuals. The SEC also previously charged Brandon Wong's brother and tippee Brian Wong in connection with the same scheme.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Becker with violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and of Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties. Subject to court approval, Becker has consented to the entry of injunctive relief, with monetary remedies to be determined at a later date, upon a motion by the SEC.\n\nThe case originated from the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious trading patterns.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York filed parallel criminal charges against Becker.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Tracy Sivitz and John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit and by Chevon Walker and Neil Hendelman of the New York Regional Office. This case has been supervised by Market Abuse Unit Chief Joseph G. Sansone. Mses. Sivitz and Walker will lead the SEC's litigation. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Aras Investment Business Group S.A.P.I. de C.V., Armando Gutierrez Rosas, Maria de Lourdes Tolentino Roque, Diayanira Rendon Trejo, Efren Norberto Quiroz Gardea and Luis Ricardo Quiroz Gardea, No. 3:23-civ-353 (W.D. Tex. filed Sept. 21, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Mexico-Based Company, Its CEO, and Four Individuals in Ponzi Scheme Targeting Spanish-Speaking U.S. Investors\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Mexico-based company Aras Investment Business Group S.A.P.I. de C.V., its CEO Armando Gutierrez Rosas, and four individuals for fraudulently raising at least $15 million from more than 450 retail investors in the U.S., most of whom were members of the Mexican American community.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleges that, from about March 2020 through November 2021, Gutierrez raised money from retail investors in the U.S. for the purported purpose of investing in U.S. real estate and mining operations in Mexico, promising investors monthly returns as high as 10 percent. According to the complaint, no U.S. investor funds were used for investment purposes; instead, Gutierrez was operating a Ponzi scheme and affinity fraud and used investor funds to pay for his personal expenses including a $2.5 million mansion in Texas. Along with Gutierrez, the SEC also charged Efren Quiroz, Luis Quiroz, Maria Tolentino, and Diayanira Rendon for their roles in the alleged fraud.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Gutierrez and Aras with violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. It also charges Gutierrez with control person liability under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint charges Efren and Luis Quiroz with acting as unregistered brokers in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and, along with Tolentino, with violating Section 5 of the Securities Act and aiding and abetting Gutierrez's and Aras's violations of the antifraud provisions. The complaint also charges Rendon with aiding and abetting Gutierrez' and Aras' violations of the antifraud provisions Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. The SEC's complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement with prejudgment interest.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Efren and Luis Quiroz, Tolentino, and Rendon consented to the entry of judgments against them as to all claims, including full injunctive relief against future violations, with disgorgement and penalties to be determined by the court upon motion by the Commission. The settlements are subject to court approval. Efren and Luis Quiroz also consented to settled Commission orders barring each of them from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization; and from participation in a penny stock offering.\n\nThe SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force have issued an\u00a0Investor Alert\u00a0with tips on how investors should avoid investment decisions based solely on common ties with someone recommending or selling the investment.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Stephen T.

Luis Jimenez Carrillo, et al., Civil Action No. 1:21-cv-11272 (D. Mass. filed Aug. 4, 2021)\n\nSEC Obtains Judgment Totaling More Than $50 Million Against Individual for Participating in Fraudulent Microcap Scheme\n\n\n\nOn September 19, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Mexican resident Luis Jimenez Carrillo for participating in a fraudulent scheme involving unlawful microcap stock sales. The judgment ordered Carrillo to pay more than $50 million.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s action alleges that, from at least 2013 through May 2019, Mexican resident Carrillo concealed the fact that he and others controlled the securities of numerous microcap companies whose stock was publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets. According to the complaint, Carrillo secretly sold millions of the companies\u2019 shares in violation of the securities laws, often after organizing promotional campaigns to encourage investors to buy the stock. Justin Wall, Jamie Wilson, and Amar Bahadoorsingh allegedly worked with Carrillo to gain control of at least one company\u2019s securities and fraudulently sell them. The complaint alleges that, as a result of these actions, what appeared to be ordinary trading by unaffiliated investors was actually a massive selling of shares orchestrated by Carrillo, Bahadoorsingh, Wall, and Wilson, who were seeking to profit at the expense of defrauded investors.\n\nOn September 19, 2023, the court entered a final judgment by default against Carrillo, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act, and the ownership reporting provisions of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act. The judgment ordered Carrillo to pay disgorgement of $39,334,544 and prejudgment interest of $7,782,751, and a civil penalty of $5,803,954.\n\nThe court previously entered judgments against Bahadoorsingh, Wall, and Wilson, and two relief defendants, the Martha Y. Jimenez Trust and the Charles A. Carrillo Trust, which received illicit proceeds from the fraudulent scheme.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case was handled by Kathleen Shields, Susan Cooke, and Ryan Murphy of the Boston Regional Office.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Robert Del Prete., No. 3:23-cv-20452 (D.N.J. filed Sept. 18, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Former SPAC Accounting Consultant with Insider Trading\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Robert Del Prete with insider trading in the shares of HighCape Capital Acquisition Corp. (\"HighCape\"), a special purpose acquisition company, on the basis of material non-public information relating to its merger with Quantum-Si Incorporated (\"QSI\").\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, Del Prete, an accounting consultant to HighCape, was present at HighCape's board meetings on January 27 and February 17, 2021 at which the planned merger with QSI was discussed. The complaint alleges that Del Prete, who had agreed to keep HighCape's proprietary information confidential, bought shares of HighCape on February 17, 2021, less than an hour after attending the board meeting that day. The complaint further alleges that, within hours of HighCape's February 18, 2021 press release announcing the deal, Del Prete liquidated his position, realizing an approximate one-hundred percent profit of $60,170 from his illegal trading. According to the complaint, when later questioned about his trades, Del Prete falsely reported to HighCape's Chief Financial Officer that he was not aware of the planned merger before the press release, although the two had been working on various aspects of the deal from at least January 27, 2021.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, charged Del Prete with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Del Prete, without admitting or denying the allegations, has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and barring him from acting as an officer or director of a public company. Del Prete also agreed to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and a civil money penalty, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. The proposed settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nIn a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey filed criminal charges against Del Prete.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Ibrahim Sajalieu Bah of the New York Regional Office.

Jonathan J. Ferrie, No. 3:23-cv-01217 (D. Conn. filed Sept. 18, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Financial Professional with Insider Trading in His Company's Securities\n\n\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against Connecticut resident Jonathan J. Ferrie, a financial professional formerly employed at the Cigna Group, for insider trading in advance of Cigna's quarterly earnings announcement in August 2021. Ferrie has agreed to settle the charges by, among other things, paying a total of over $33,000 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleges that Jonathan J. Ferrie, of Prospect, Connecticut, traded in the securities of his former employer, Cigna, on the basis of material non-public information that he obtained as the financial controller of a division of Cigna's health insurance business. According to the SEC's complaint, in June 2021, Ferrie learned that his division's profitability during the second quarter of 2021 was below expectations due to unexpected increases in health insurance costs related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The SEC alleges that Ferrie immediately purchased Cigna stock options that would be profitable to Ferrie only if Cigna's stock fell substantially in price by mid-August 2021, and Ferrie allegedly knew that Cigna would announce its quarterly financial performance by early August 2021. The SEC further alleges that, on August 5, 2021, Cigna announced higher-than-expected increases in medical costs that Cigna had to cover as its health insurance customers emerged from pandemic lockdowns -- the same metric that Ferrie had seen within his own division. The SEC alleges that Cigna's stock price immediately dropped by 13 percent following the announcement. According to the SEC's complaint, Ferrie sold his options on the morning of the public announcement, making a profit of approximately $16,000, an approximately 236% return on the amount he had invested. The SEC alleges that Ferrie's trades violated Cigna's written policy expressly forbidding both insider trading and trading by employees in options on Cigna stock.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Ferrie consented to the entry of a judgment ordering a permanent injunction prohibiting him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Ferrie also agreed to pay $16,039.78 in disgorgement, $1,497.17 in prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty of $16,039.78. Ferrie also agreed to be barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company for a period of three years. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's case was handled by Jeffrey Cook, John McCann, Michael Moran, and Celia Moore of the SEC's Boston Regional Office.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Esos Rings, Inc. and Michelle Silverstein aka Michelle Silverstein Bisnoff, No. 2:23-cv-07553 (C.D. Cal., filed Sept. 12, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Files Settled Fraud Charges Against Los Angeles-Based \"Smart Ring\" Company and Its Principal\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that Esos Rings, Inc., and its principal, Michelle Silverstein aka Michelle Silverstein Bisnoff, have agreed to settle charges that they defrauded investors by selling them Esos stock through false and misleading statements about Esos's business and by operating a Ponzi-like scheme.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, from February 2017 to June 2022, Esos and Bisnoff fraudulently raised $1.95 million from investors. The complaint alleges that Esos was purportedly in the business of manufacturing and selling smart rings, which were wearable rings that functioned as a debit card. As alleged in the complaint, Esos and Bisnoff raised money from investors through false statements, including that Esos owned the patents for the smart rings and that Esos was being acquired by Apple. The complaint also alleges that Esos and Bisnoff operated a Ponzi-like scheme by using new investor money to pay off previous investors.\n\nEsos and Bisnoff, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, consented to the entry of final judgments, subject to court approval, that would permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and hold them jointly and severally liable to pay disgorgement of $566,483 in disgorgement and $46,836 in prejudgment interest. Bisnoff also consented to an officer-and-director bar, a $233,229 civil penalty, and a permanent injunction prohibiting her from directly or indirectly, including, but not limited to, through any entity owned or controlled by her, participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security in an unregistered offering, provided, however, that such injunction shall not prevent Bisnoff from purchasing or selling securities listed on a national securities exchange for her own personal account.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by staff in the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Stubos, et al.;, ivil Action No. 1:22-cv-04674 (S.D.N.Y filed June 6, 2022)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Canadian Individual in Fraudulent Microcap Scheme\n\n\n\nOn September 8, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Canadian resident George Stubos. In June 2022, the SEC charged Stubos for engaging in a deceptive scheme involving several microcap companies.\u00c2\u00a0Among other relief, the judgment orders Stubos to pay more than $6 million.\n\nThe SEC's action alleges that Stubos secretly gained control of several thinly traded microcap companies whose stock was publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets, hired stock promoters to create demand for his stock, and generated substantial illicit profits by selling the stock to unsuspecting investors. Stubos allegedly hid the fact that he controlled the majority of the stock of the publicly traded companies. He allegedly misled investors, brokers, and transfer agents (companies that maintain records of stock ownership) in order to convince these parties that his stock shares were eligible for trading in the public markets, when in fact he did not register his sales of those stock with the Commission and did not disclose accurate information about his control over the companies. Stubos also engaged in manipulative trading to create the appearance of active market trading and thus increased investor demand for the stock. The court entered the final judgment against Stubos by consent. Stubos, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the market manipulation provisions of Section 9(a) of the Exchange Act. Stubos' judgment orders him to pay disgorgement of $5,367,926 and prejudgment interest of $806,108 and it imposes a penny stock bar and a conduct-based injunction that prohibits Stubos from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security other than for his own personal accounts. The complaint also seeks relief from Dori-Ann Stubos, George Stubos' wife, who allegedly received illicit proceeds from Stubos' fraudulent scheme, and that action remains ongoing.\n\nThe SEC's case is being handled by Kathleen Shields, Alfred Day, and Ryan Murphy of the Boston Regional Office.\n\n\n\tJudgment\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Brady Jack Speers, Chatree Thiranon, and GHAP, LLC d/b/a Blue Star Texas, No. 4:2323-cv-00905 (N.D. Tex. filed Aug. 31, 2023)\n\nSEC Charges Recidivist and Others in Real Estate Offering Fraud\n\u00a0\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint against Brady Speers, Chatree \u201cBen\u201d Thiranon, and GHAP, LLC d/b/a Blue Star Texas (\u201cBlue Star\u201d) for running a fraudulent house-flipping scheme that raised almost $8 million from 40 investors through the unregistered sale of promissory notes. \u00a0Speers, Thiranon, and Blue Star represented that they would use investor funds to buy, renovate, and sell residential properties. \u00a0The SEC\u2019s complaint alleges, however, that the defendants misused more than $2.9 million of investor funds to pay personal expenses and to make Ponzi-like payments.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Speers, Thiranon, and Blue Star, a company they owned and controlled, raised funds by misrepresenting and omitting material information. \u00a0The SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that Blue Star told investors that their funds were secured by property interests in the real estate assets underlying the investments, when in reality Blue Star only secured investor interests in isolated instances and sometimes never even held title to the properties at issue. \u00a0The SEC also alleges that Blue Star rolled over investor funds to other projects without required authorization. \u00a0Additionally, the complaint alleges that Blue Star touted Speers\u2019s business experience and background without also disclosing that the SEC charged him with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in 2015 and that he filed for personal bankruptcy on two separate occasions.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, charges Speers, Thiranon, and Blue Star with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and the securities-registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. \u00a0Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Speers, Thiranon, and Blue Star have agreed to a partial settlement, consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions and orders each to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts that will be determined by the court upon future motion of the SEC. \u00a0Speers and Thiranon have also consented to conduct-based injunctions and bars from serving as an officer or director of a public company. \u00a0Finally, the defendants have agreed to the appointment of a liquidation agent to sell properties that are under renovation. \u00a0The partial settlements are subject to Court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Jeaneen Kappell, Carol Hahn, and Jamie Haussecker of the Fort Worth Regional Office, under the supervision of Jim Etri and Eric Werner. \u00a0The litigation will be conducted by Jason Reinsch and supervised by B.

Bittrex Inc., Bittrex Global GmbH, and William Hiroaki Shihara, Civ. Action 2:23-cv-00580-RSM (W.D. Wash. filed April 17, 2023)\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment against Bittrex, Inc. and Bittrex Global Gmbh\n\n\n\nOn August 15, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against crypto asset trading platform Bittrex Inc. (\u201cBittrex\u201d), its co-founder and former CEO, William Shihara (Shihara\u201d), and Bittrex\u2019s foreign affiliate, Bittrex Global GmbH (\u201cBittrex Global\u201d).\u00a0 The SEC previously charged Bittrex with operating as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency, and charged Shihara as a control person for Bittrex\u2019s violations.\u00a0 The SEC also charged Bittrex Global for failing to register as a national securities exchange.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on April 17, 2023 in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleged that Bittrex acted as an unregistered broker, exchange, and clearing agency by providing services to U.S. investors in connection with crypto assets that the SEC\u2019s complaint alleged were offered and sold as securities. The complaint further alleged that Bittrex and Shihara directed issuers who sought to have their crypto assets made available for trading on Bittrex\u2019s platform to first delete from public channels certain \u201cproblematic statements\u201d that Shihara believed would lead a regulator, such as the SEC, to investigate whether the crypto asset was offered and sold as a security. Prior to the filing of the SEC\u2019s complaint, Bittrex announced its intention to shut down its trading platform in the United States and, on May 8, 2023, filed for bankruptcy in the state of Delaware.\n\nAs part of the settlement, the defendants consented to entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin Bittrex and Shihara from violating Sections 5, 15(a), and 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and enjoin Bittrex Global from violating Section 5 of the same Act. In addition, under the terms of the judgment, Bittrex and Bittrex Global will pay, on a joint and several basis, disgorgement of $14.4 million, prejudgment interest of $4 million, and a civil penalty of $5.6 million, for a total monetary payment of $24 million.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Daphna Waxman and Pamela Sawhney of the Division of Enforcement\u2019s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, Ainsley Kerr of the Market Abuse Unit, and Jordan Baker, Neil Hendelman, and Lisa Knoop of the New York Regional Office. It was supervised by Mark R. Sylvester, Jorge Tenreiro, and David Hirsch of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. The SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by Ben Kuruvilla, Michael Welsh, and Christopher Carney and supervised by Ladan Stewart and Olivia Choe.

The complaint also states that, before Anthony's deposits reversed for insufficient funds in his bank account, he used \"immediate access\" credit extended to him by his broker-dealer to purchase $199,956.65 in securities. According to the complaint, Anthony's broker-dealer discovered the scheme before Anthony could make any profits, froze his account, and liquidated his holdings.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, charges Anthony with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Anthony has consented to a judgment, which, subject to court approval, would permanently enjoin him from violating the charged provisions, impose injunctions on his future brokerage activities, and impose a civil penalty in an amount to be determined at a later date by the court upon motion of the Commission.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Brian M.

Ill. filed Dec. 17, 2021)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against IIIinois Resident for Insider Trading\n\n\n\nOn August 18, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Daniel V.T. Catenacci for insider trading in the securities of biotechnology company Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. in advance of the company's November 10, 2020 announcement that it had achieved positive drug trial results for its flagship cancer drug Bemarituzumab.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed on December 17, 2021, alleges that Catenacci, a Chicago, Illinois based medical doctor, entered into a consulting agreement with Five Prime to serve as a lead clinical investigator for the company's Bemarituzumab drug trial. Through this role, Catenacci allegedly learned material nonpublic information about the positive drug trial results for Bemarituzumab. According to the SEC, shortly after he allegedly learned of the positive results, Catenacci purchased 8,743 shares of Five Prime. After the company publicly announced the positive drug trial results, Five Prime's share price increased over 300%. The next day, Catenacci allegedly sold all of his shares, realizing illicit gains of $134,142.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Catenacci consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment also orders Catenacci to pay a $50,000 penalty.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Madiha M. Zuberi of the San Francisco Regional Office, with assistance from John S.

Vika in fact never owned or acquired the pre-IPO securities.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed on December 7, 2022 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, alleged that Vika and its co-founder George Iakovou held Vika out as a purported venture capital firm while using Vika to engage in the pre-IPO scheme. Vika and Iakovou thereby defrauded at least 46 individual investors of more than $6 million. The complaint also alleged that Penelope Zbravos negligently performed tasks at Vika that perpetuated the scheme.\n\nOn June 22, 2023, the district court entered a consent judgment as to Zbravos. The judgment enjoins her from further violations of Section\u00c2\u00a017(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and provides that, upon subsequent motion of the Commission, the court will determine any monetary relief against her.\n\nOn June 30, 2023, the district court entered Amended Default Judgments against Iakovou and Vika. Those judgments enjoin each of them from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, imposing an additional conduct-based injunction and an officer and director bar against Iakovou, and providing that, upon subsequent motions of the Commission, the court would determine any monetary relief against those defendants.\n\nOn August 7, 2023, the Commission moved the district court for a penalty against Vika. On August 9, 2023, the district court granted the motion and entered a Final Judgment against Vika, enjoining it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act; and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(a), (b), and (c) and ordering Vika to pay a civil money penalty of $8,929,120.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Allison M.

Colo. filed Aug. 8, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Former Hedge Fund Managing Director with Fraud\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled fraud charges against Chad Stickforth, the former managing director of RSF Capital, LP, related to the misuse and misappropriation of millions of dollars raised from investors. \u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal district court in Colorado, alleges that between December 2016 and September 2021, Stickforth, through RSF, raised approximately $5.4 million from twenty investors after telling investors that RSF would use their money to trade futures contracts, commodity interests, and options on their behalf. In fact, the complaint alleges, Stickforth only used a small portion of the investors\u2019 money to trade, and he misappropriated or otherwise misused most of the investors\u2019 funds by using them for personal expenses, payments to his business partner, and Ponzi-like payments to investors to keep up the appearance of profitable trading.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Stickforth has consented to the entry of a final judgment that would permanently enjoin him from violating the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; impose a permanent officer-and-director bar; and order him to pay $1,546,197 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $223,229. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by John Dwyer, Yamini Piplani Grema, and Daniel Konosky, with the assistance of Terry Miller and Gregory Kasper, and was supervised by Danielle R.

Charles Rustin Holzer et al., No. 23 Civ. 6753 (S.D.N.Y. filed Aug. 2, 2023)\n\n\n\nFinal Judgment Entered Against Florida Investment Adviser Charged a Second Time for Insider Trading\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has obtained a final consent judgment against Charles Rustin Holzer, a family office executive and former broker charged with insider trading in stock of Dun & Bradstreet Corp. (DNB). Final consent judgments were also entered against two offshore entities named as relief defendants in the SEC's complaint.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, nine days before an August 8, 2018, acquisition announcement, Holzer, of Wellington, Florida, learned material nonpublic information about the prospective DNB acquisition from an investment adviser pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement that prohibited him from disclosing or trading on the information. The SEC alleged that Holzer used that information to purchase 23,000 shares of DNB stock in offshore accounts belonging to two Cayman Islands-based entities that Holzer directly or indirectly controlled, Maglione International Ltd. and Frontenac Investments Ltd., resulting in $391,308 in ill-gotten profits. Although those trades took place at roughly the same time as trades in DNB options that were the subject of a prior investigation and settled lawsuit against Holzer, according to the SEC's complaint filed August 2, 2023, Holzer did not disclose the offshore trading to the SEC in connection with that earlier lawsuit.\n\nOn August 4, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Holzer, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $1,173,926. The same day, the Court also entered final judgments against Maglione and Frontenac, ordering that they pay disgorgement of $331,389 and $59,920, respectively, representing the amount of profits from Holzer's DNB trading in their respective accounts, plus prejudgment interest of $84,032 (for Maglione) and $15,194 (for Frontenac).\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Derek Schoenmann and Elizabeth Baier of the New York Regional Office.

Christopher A. Slaga a/k/a Keith Renko, Q4 Capital, LLC, J4 Capital Advisors LLC, and Hayden F. Greene, No. 8:23-cv-01425 (C.D. Cal. filed August 7, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Recidivist and Others in Offering Fraud Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filed today a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California charging Christopher Slaga and two entities he controlled, Q4 Capital, LLC and J4 Capital Advisors LLC, with defrauding investors through an offering of interests in purported private investment funds. Slaga received approximately $3.5 million in proceeds from the fraudulent scheme. The SEC also charged Hayden F. Greene for acting as an unregistered broker.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that Slaga, a recidivist, operated his fraudulent scheme under the alias \"Keith Renko.\" According to the complaint, Slaga, through the entities he controlled and posing as Renko, marketed and sold interests in three private investment funds that he managed. Slaga represented to investors that he would use their funds to execute certain securities trading strategies. The SEC alleges that, in reality, Slaga never formed the investment funds, did not trade securities on behalf of the investment funds, and misused the vast majority of investor money for personal expenses. Moreover, as alleged in the complaint, to conceal his fraud, Slaga forged documents that purported to reflect that the investment funds had brokerage accounts at a major firm, were audited by a Big Four auditor, and were profitable. The complaint alleges, however, that the funds did not have brokerage accounts, were not audited by any firm, and were not profitable.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Slaga, Q4 Capital, LLC, and J4 Capital Advisors LLC with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and the securities-registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The SEC's complaint also charges Greene with violating the broker-registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act for acting as an unregistered broker. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, an officer-and-director bar (as to Slaga only), disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties (except as to Greene). Greene has agreed to consent to the entry of a final judgment against him that addresses all of the charges and relief sought by the SEC, and his settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Melanie K. Good and supervised by Nikolay V. Vydashenko and Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC's litigation is being conducted by Jason P. Reinsch and supervised by B. David Fraser.

(formerly BitTorrent)\u2014engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of TRX and BTT, and fraudulently manipulated the secondary market for these securities through extensive wash trading.\u00a0 The SEC also alleged that Sun and his companies orchestrated a campaign to pay influential celebrities\u2014including Mahone and codefendant DeAndre Cortez Way (a/k/a Soulja Boy)\u2014to promote TRX and BTT on social media without disclosing the fact that they were being paid to do so.\n\nThe final judgment, entered with Mahone\u2019s consent, permanently enjoins him from violating the anti-touting provisions of Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, imposes a three-year conduct-based injunction precluding any compensated touting of crypto asset securities, and orders him to pay $7,507 disgorgement plus $682 prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $37,535.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ongoing litigation against Justin Sun, his companies, and DeAndre Cortez Way is being led by Timothy Halloran and Adam B.

Ulrich Kranz and Paul Balciunas, No. 23-cv-06332 (C.D. Cal. filed Aug. 4, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Electric Vehicle Company and Former CEO and CFO for Misconduct Related to Spac Transaction\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Canoo Inc., a company that designs and produces electric vehicles, its former Chief Executive Officer, Ulrich Kranz, and its former Chief Financial Officer, Paul Balciunas, for making inaccurate revenue projections. The SEC also charged Canoo and Kranz with misconduct related to nearly $1 million in undisclosed executive compensation.\n\nThe SEC's complaint against Kranz and Balciunas, filed in federal district court in California, alleges that from August 2020 until March 2021, during which time Canoo became publicly listed through a transaction with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Canoo's public financial projections were materially inaccurate. According to the complaint, Canoo projected revenue of $120 million for 2021 and $250 million for 2022, in connection with the provision of engineering services to other companies; these projections were allegedly unreasonable because, as Kranz and Balciunas should have known, the two projects on which Canoo based nearly all of its projected revenue were no longer active or feasible. The complaint further alleges that in November 2019, Kranz entered into an agreement with two individuals who were significant investors in Canoo to receive up to $1 million in compensation related to his work at Canoo, and in October 2020, Kranz received over $900,000 from these two individuals. According to the complaint, this undisclosed arrangement caused Canoo to make inaccurate executive compensation disclosures from September 2020 until April 2021.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Kranz and Balciunas have each consented to the entry of judgments against them, which are subject to court approval. Kranz agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the proxy solicitation provisions of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder, as well as from aiding and abetting violations of the reporting provisions of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-11 thereunder. Kranz also consented to a three-year officer and director bar and payment of a $125,000 civil penalty. Balciunas agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-3 thereunder, as well as from aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-11 thereunder. Balciunas further consented to a two-year officer and director bar, payment of $7,500 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty.\n\nThe SEC also instituted a related settled administrative proceeding against Canoo. Without admitting or denying the findings, Canoo agreed to the entry of a cease-and-desist order prohibiting further violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder. Canoo also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1,500,000.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by John Dwyer and Anne Romero, with the assistance of Christopher Martin and Gregory Kasper, and was supervised by Danielle R. Voorhees, Nicholas P. Heinke, and Jason J. Burt, all of the SEC's Denver Regional Office.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Mass. filed August 3, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Massachusetts Resident with $1.2 Million Offering Fraud and Ponzi Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Brockton, Massachusetts resident Jose D. Rocha for running a Ponzi scheme in which he took approximately $1.2 million from 13 investors in the Cape Verdean community around the Boston area. Rocha promised investors he would invest their money in securities with guaranteed returns of 12% per month. Instead, Rocha used only a small percentage of the money to make highly leveraged, and highly unsuccessful, trades of stock and stock options. Rocha spent the balance of the funds, the vast majority, to feed his gambling habit and embark on a luxury lifestyle. Rocha also used money from later investments to pay out on earlier investments.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, charges Rocha with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. To settle the charges, Rocha consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and from participating in the offer or sale of any security to investors or potential investors, with the amounts of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties to be determined by the Court.\n\nIn a parallel action, Rocha pled guilty to criminal charges of securities fraud filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts.\n\nThe SEC's case is being handled by Jeffrey Cook, Patrick Noone, Alfred Day, and Celia Moore of the SEC's Boston Regional Office.

Ustocktrade LLC, No. 1:23-cv-06756 (S.D.N.Y. filed Aug. 2, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Owners of Broker-Dealer with Aiding and Abetting Violations of Net Capital Requirements\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Ustocktrade LLC and its owner Anthony Weeresinghe of Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts with aiding and abetting a registered broker-dealer's repeated violations of the SEC's net capital provisions. The SEC's net capital provisions are designed to ensure that broker-dealers have adequate liquid assets to meet their obligations to their customers.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that Weeresinghe, through Ustocktrade LLC, owned and controlled an SEC-registered broker-dealer, Ustocktrade Securities, Inc., which operated an alternative trading system that was marketed to college students and other retail investors to engage in day trading. According to the SEC's complaint, Weeresinghe and Ustocktrade LLC were notified of 11 separate periods during 2021 when the broker-dealer's net capital fell below its minimum net capital requirement. The complaint alleges that Ustocktrade LLC and Weeresinghe substantially assisted the broker-dealer's net capital violations by continuing to operate the broker-dealer's customer trading platforms to conduct unlawful securities transactions during the deficiency periods. In addition, as alleged in the complaint, in November 2021, during the broker-dealer's final net capital deficiency, Weeresinghe directed the broker-dealer to transfer most of its remaining cash to Ustocktrade LLC, worsening the capital condition of an already capital deficient broker-dealer. In October 2022, the broker-dealer withdrew and terminated its registration with the SEC.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Weeresinghe and Ustocktrade LLC with aiding and abetting the broker-dealer's violations of the net capital provisions of Section 15(c)(3) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15c3-l thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Weeresinghe and Ustocktrade LLC agreed to settle with the SEC and to the entry of a final judgment imposing permanent injunctions and penalties of $75,000 against Ustocktrade LLC and $10,000 against Weeresinghe.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Stephen LeBlanc, Timothy Halloran, and Dan Furlano and was supervised by Lisa Deitch, Peter Rosario, and Stacy Bogert.

Charles Rustin Holzer et al., No. 23 Civ. 6753 (S.D.N.Y. filed August 2, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Florida Investment Adviser a Second Time for Insider Trading\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed insider trading charges against Charles Rustin Holzer, a family office executive and former broker who last year settled SEC charges that he traded in options of Dun & Bradstreet Corp. (DNB) on inside information. The SEC's latest complaint alleges that, in addition to the options trades that were the subject of the SEC's prior lawsuit, Holzer also placed unlawful trades in DNB stock through offshore accounts that were not disclosed to the SEC in connection with the prior investigation and settlement.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint filed today, nine days before an August 8, 2018, acquisition announcement, Holzer, of Wellington, Florida, learned material nonpublic information about the prospective DNB acquisition from an investment adviser pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement that prohibited him from disclosing or trading on the information. The SEC alleges that Holzer used that information to purchase 23,000 shares of DNB stock in offshore accounts belonging to two Cayman Islands-based entities that Holzer directly or indirectly controlled, Maglione International Ltd. and Frontenac Investments Ltd., resulting in $391,308 in ill-gotten profits. Although those trades took place at roughly the same time as the options trades at issue in the prior lawsuit, according to the SEC's complaint, Holzer did not disclose the offshore trading to the SEC.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the Southern District of New York, charges Holzer with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctive relief and civil penalties, as well as disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from Maglione and Frontenac, which are named as relief defendants. Holzer, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $1,173,926. Maglione and Frontenac, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, have consented to the entry of final judgments ordering that they pay disgorgement of $331,389 and $59,920, respectively, representing the amount of profits from Holzer's DNB trading in their respective accounts, plus prejudgment interest of $84,032 (for Maglione) and $15,194 (for Frontenac). The proposed settlements are subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Derek Schoenmann and Elizabeth Baier of the New York Regional Office. The investigation was supervised by Celeste Chase and Thomas P. Smith, Jr. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Cal. filed Dec. 17, 2019)\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Silicon Valley IT Administrator at the Center of Multimillion Dollar Insider Trading Ring\n\n\n\nOn August 1, 2023, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California entered a final judgment, by consent, against Janardhan Nellore. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Nellore, a former IT administrator at Palo Alto Networks, Inc., alleging that he traded on confidential earnings information about Palo Alto Networks and tipped four of his friends to do the same, in violation of the federal securities laws. In settling the charges against him, Nellore agreed to pay $16,614 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on December 17, 2019, alleges that Nellore was at the center of an insider trading ring and used his IT credentials and work contacts to obtain highly confidential information about his employer\u2019s quarterly earnings and financial performance. As alleged in the complaint, Nellore and his friends achieved more than $7 million in illegal profits. Three of Nellore\u2019s co-defendants previously settled the SEC\u2019s action against them.

The\u00a0SEC previously filed an enforcement action against Brent Seaman, the Accanito LLCs, and affiliated entities on July 27, 2023, in connection with the alleged scheme.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, from approximately June 2019 until September 2022, Cathey sold at least $4.655 million of Accanito LLCs' securities to 15 retail investors located in 5 states. During that period, Cathey received approximately $760,729 in transaction-based sales commissions from Accanito, even though he was not registered as a broker-dealer or permitted to sell securities.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Cathey with violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Cathey agreed to the entry of a judgment providing injunctive relief with disgorgement and civil penalties to be determined by a court at a later date. Cathey also agreed to associational and penny stock bars with a right to reapply after 5 years as part of a settled follow-on administrative proceeding.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was part of the Miami Regional Office's Fraud Against Minority Groups Initiative and was conducted by Andre Zamorano, Alise Johnson, and Mark Dee in the Miami Regional Office and supervised by Thierry Olivier Desmet, Fernando Torres, and Glenn S.

The complaint also alleges that Saw liquidated all of the customer's securities holdings without the customer's consent, and then transferred all of the investment proceeds to her own personal bank and brokerage accounts. The complaint further alleges that Saw used a portion of the misappropriated funds to pay for her personal expenses, including approximately $100,000 in car and mortgage payments and thousands of dollars of cash withdrawals, and that Saw used additional misappropriated funds to purchase securities in her own personal brokerage account.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Saw with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Cal. filed July 28, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Real Estate Investment Fund with Offering Fraud Targeting Investors in Chinese-Speaking Communities\n\n\n\nThe SEC brought charges against Summitcrest Capital, Inc., and its principals, Johnny\u00a0Tseng and Kevin Zhang, for conducting an offering fraud through their real estate investment fund, SC Development Fund, LLC. SC Development Fund raised approximately $19.8 million from about 30 investors in the United States and China between February 2018 and November 2019. SC\u00a0Development Fund filed for bankruptcy in July 2020 and is now defunct.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that SC Development Fund - formerly known as SC Development Fund V, LLC - was a real estate investment fund managed by Tseng and Zhang through Summitcrest, which they co-owned. As alleged, SC Development Fund sought investors for its unregistered offering from Chinese-speaking communities in the United States and China. According to the SEC's complaint, SC Development Fund represented that it would use investor funds to make real-estate related loans \"to the general public\" and utilize income from these loans to make promised interest payments and return of capital to investors. The SEC alleges that contrary to these representations, SC Development Fund used investor funds exclusively for loans to Zhang's real estate development and contracting business, and at least twelve other real estate development entities under Zhang's control. In addition, the complaint alleges that Tseng and Zhang misled investors by using investor funds to pay purported finder's fees to two entities that were supposed to be independent third parties, but were in fact controlled by Tseng or Zhang.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, which was filed in the Central District of California, charges Summitcrest, Tseng, and Zhang with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Summitcrest, Tseng, and Zhang, and officer and director bars against Tseng and Zhang.\n\nSummitcrest and Tseng, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, consented, pre-filing, to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining each of them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act; prohibiting each of them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security (provided, however, that such injunction would not prevent Tseng from purchasing or selling securities for his own personal account); ordering Summitcrest to pay disgorgement of $16,600,000.00, plus prejudgment interest of $4,349,481.52, on a joint and several basis with Tseng and Zhang, and to pay a $2,232,280.00 civil penalty; ordering Tseng to pay disgorgement of $16,600,000.00, plus prejudgment interest of $4,349,481.52, on a joint and several basis with Summitcrest and Zhang, as well as disgorgement of $60,000.00, plus prejudgment interest of $15,721.03, on an individual basis, and to pay a $414,366.00 civil penalty; and imposing an officer and director bar against Tseng.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Marisa Westervelt and Carol Kim and was supervised by Victoria A.

Accanito Holdings, LLC., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-22791 (S.D. Fla. filed July 27, 2023).\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Florida Resident with Operating $35 Million Ponzi Scheme that Targeted Church Members\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged Brent Seaman of Naples, Florida, and various entities he managed for fraudulently raising approximately $35 million from at least 60 investors through an unregistered securities offering. Many of these investors were elderly, retired, and connected to a Naples church where Seaman was an active member.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that, from approximately June 2019 until September 2022, Seaman told investors he would use their money to invest in technology companies and to trade currencies and commodities. Seaman falsely promised annual returns ranging between 18 and 48 percent and described the investments as \"safe\" and the returns as \"guaranteed.\" The complaint further alleges that Seaman solicited investors by touting his proven success investing in currencies when, in reality, he was losing millions of dollars of investors' money and his currency trading was always unprofitable. Seaman also allegedly misappropriated\u00a0millions of dollars for himself, in part to purchase luxury automobiles and to pay for trips on private planes. Finally, Seaman allegedly made Ponzi-like payments to investors because he did not generate profits in connection with his trading sufficient to pay investors their required monthly distributions.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges Seaman, Accanito Holdings, LLC, and Accanito Equity, LLC, Accanito Equity II, LLC, Accanito Equity III, LLC, and Accanito Equity IV, LLC (collectively the Accanito LLCs) with violating the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). The complaint also charges Seaman, the Accanito LLCs, and two related entities, Accanito Capital Group, and Surge LLC, with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Finally, the complaint charges Seaman with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint names as relief defendants, and seeks disgorgement with prejudgment interest from, Seaman's wife, Jana Seaman, and two affiliated entities (Valo Holdings Group, LLC, and Surge Capital Ventures, LLC) that allegedly together received millions in investor proceeds.\n\nAll fraud defendants have consented to a bifurcated settlement, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations and subject to court approval, under which they will be enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and Seaman will be barred from serving as an officer or director of any SEC-reporting company. Additionally, the defendants agree that the court will determine whether it is appropriate to order them to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty. Relief defendant Jana Seaman has agreed to pay $757,154 in disgorgement and interest. Relief defendant Valo Holdings Group has agreed to pay $668,240 in disgorgement and interest.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was part of the Miami Regional Office's Fraud Against Minority Groups Initiative and was conducted by Andre Zamorano, Alise Johnson, and Mark Dee in the Miami Regional Office and supervised by Thierry Olivier Desmet, Fernando Torres, and Glenn S.

ARO Equity, LCC et al., Civil Action No. 19-civ-10027 (D. Mass., filed January 8, 2020)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgments Against Principals of Investment Firm Charged with Fraudulently Misleading Investors\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has obtained final judgments in a previously-filed case against Thomas D. Renison and Timothy J. Allcott, whom the agency charged with making false statements to current and prospective retail investors about the performance of the investment firm they controlled, ARO Equity, LLC, and with using investor funds to pay interest to other investors. Among other things, the judgments order the defendants to pay a total of $12,348,181, with that amount deemed satisfied by orders of forfeiture and restitution in parallel criminal actions.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint filed in January 2020, in July 2014, Renison, a Connecticut resident, was barred by the SEC from, among other things, associating with any investment adviser or broker-dealer. Nevertheless, the complaint alleges that, from at least July 2015 through June 2018, Renison violated this bar when he, along with Allcott, a Massachusetts resident, formed ARO Equity as an investment adviser firm and raised approximately $6 million from at least 15 investors. The SEC's complaint alleges that Renison and Allcott falsely touted ARO Equity's success to encourage potential investors to cash out of their retirement products and invest with them in ARO Equity. The complaint alleges that soon after the defendants launched the firm, ARO Equity's investments began to fail. Rather than inform their clients of the losses, Renison and Allcott continued to falsely promote ARO Equity's success and the security of investing with them. Among other false statements, Renison and Allcott allegedly told investors that ARO Equity had double-digit returns, that there was no downside to investing with the firm, and that the investors' money was as safe as being in a bank. In reality, ARO Equity had experienced significant losses and had to use new investor funds to pay interest to older investors.\n\nAllcott and Renison were also charged criminally for their alleged conduct in parallel criminal proceedings on June 8, 2020. Allcott entered a guilty plea in his criminal case on July 27, 2020, and was sentenced on May 8, 2023. Renison entered a guilty plea in his criminal case on October 6, 2020, and was sentenced on May 8, 2023. Allcott received a sentence of 30 months incarceration and was ordered to pay restitution of $6,098,198.30. Renison received a sentence of 48 months incarceration and was ordered to pay restitution of 6,249,983.30.\n\nAllcott and Renision consented to final judgments, which was entered on July 27, 2023 by the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The judgment permanently enjoins Allcott and Renison from violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"), Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also permanently enjoins them from, directly or indirectly, including but not limited to, through an entity owned or controlled by them, participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, provided, however, that such injunction shall not prevent them from purchasing or selling securities for their own personal accounts. Renison was separately enjoined from violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Ordered pursuant to Section 209(d) of the Advisers Act to comply with the investment adviser and broker dealer bars reflected in the final administrative order that the Commission entered against him on July 3, 2014. The final judgments also order Allcott and Renison to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $6,098,198.30 and $6,249,983.30, respectively, with those amounts deemed satisfied by the forfeiture and restitution ordered in the parallel criminal cases. Because the defendants were sentenced to prison sentences, the Commission did not ask the court to impose civil monetary penalties against them.\n\nThe action against defendant ARO Equity remains pending.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Alexander Elbanna, Digital World Exchange, LLC, Boostedpro LLC, and D.W. Exchange, LLC, Civ. Action, o. 8:23-cv-01638 (M.D. Fla. filed July 20, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges North Carolina Resident for Conducting Fraudulent and Unregistered Offerings of Crypto Asset Securities\n\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Alexander Elbanna and three entities that he owned and controlled with engaging in a fraudulent scheme involving unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities called \"DWE\" and \"BPC.\" The SEC also charged Elbanna and one of his entities with fraudulent private offers and sales of equity securities.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, between February 2018 and April 2021, Elbanna founded and promoted, in succession, three separate business enterprises: Digital World Exchange, LLC, Boostedpro LLC, and D.W. Exchange, LLC. Each of these businesses allegedly included a proposed crypto asset trading platform and an \"in-house exchange token\" or crypto asset security whose value purportedly depended on Elbanna's successful launch of the proposed trading platform. To induce investors to purchase DWE and BPC, as well as equity securities in the corporate entity that issued DWE, the complaint alleges that Elbanna and his three entities made materially false and misleading statements to investors concerning Elbanna's level of technological experience and wealth, the risks involved in the investment, and the operation of the associated crypto asset trading platform. As a result of this misconduct, the SEC's complaint alleges that investors lost over $1 million.\n\nThe complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, charges Elbanna and his three entities with violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Each defendant, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to a bifurcated settlement, agreeing to permanent injunctions against violating the charged provisions, conduct-based injunctions, and monetary relief in an amount to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the SEC. Elbanna further consented to an officer and director bar. The settlements are subject to court approval. The complaint also names Angela Elbanna as a relief defendant.

Christensen and Anthony M. Matic, and their related entities Foresee, Inc., The Commission PDX, LLC, The Policy PDX, LLC, and Innings 150, LLC, for operating a multi-year Ponzi-like scheme.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed on June 30, 2023, alleged that from at least January 2018 through September 2022, Christensen and Matic used four entities that they founded - Foresee, Inc., The Commission PDX, LLC, The Policy PDX, LLC, and Innings, 150 LLC - to raise money from retail investors, including several retirees, for the purported purpose of investing in real estate. Christensen and Matic allegedly raised this money through the offer and sale of unregistered promissory notes, which promised high interest rates between nine and 15 percent to be paid to investors, in addition to the return of all principal, within just a few months. \u00a0In reality, the complaint alleged, Christensen and Matic did not have the ability to pay investors the promised returns within the time periods identified in the notes; instead, they relied on new investor money to pay earlier investors. \u00a0Additionally, Christensen and Matic allegedly used investor money for unauthorized and undisclosed purposes, including to pay for at least one vacation, gifts, casino trips, massages, personal expenses, a whiskey club membership, and cryotherapy.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Christensen, Matic, and their related entities consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. \u00a0The final judgments also impose conduct-based injunctions as well as $5,374,482 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. \u00a0Additionally, the final judgments order Christensen and Matic to each pay a $200,000 penalty and impose permanent officer and director bars against them.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Steven Varholik and Michael Foley, with the assistance of Marc Katz and Bernard Smyth, of the San Francisco Regional Office. \u00a0The investigation was supervised by Jason H.

Eric J. \"EJ\" Dalius et al., Civil Action No. 2:18-cv-08497 (C.D. Ca. filed Oct. 3, 2018)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Operator of Multi-Million Dollar Ponzi Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the resolution of its case against Ryan Morgan Evans, the last remaining defendant in the SEC's action arising out of a multi-million-dollar Ponzi and pyramid scheme and offering fraud known as \"Saivian.\" Evans agreed to pay $338,743 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties to settle the SEC's claims against him for his role in offering and selling unregistered securities and furthering the fraudulent scheme. The SEC previously announced final judgments in this matter against Evans' co-defendants Eric J. \"EJ\" Dalius and Saivian LLC.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleged that Evans served as a top executive in Saivian and sold \"Cashback Membership\" securities that entitled holders to receive 20 percent cash back on their retail shopping purchases every month in exchange for paying a $125 fee every 28 days and the submission of shopping receipts. According to the complaint, Evans falsely claimed that the company funded these cash back payments to members by monetizing the point-of-sale receipt data submitted by its members. Instead, Saivian allegedly operated as a Ponzi scheme by satisfying promised returns to some investors through the investments of others. Saivian also allegedly operated a pyramid scheme that promised a daily residual income stream for affiliates who sold Saivian memberships to downline recruits.\n\nThe court partially granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment on May 24, 2023, finding that undisputed facts established that Evans' offers and sales of Saivian \"Cashback Memberships\" were sales of investment contracts, and therefore of securities, and that Evans violated the federal securities laws when he offered and sold securities that were not registered.\n\nThe final judgment requires Evans to disgorge $175,000 plus prejudgment interest of $52,129, and to pay a $111,614 civil penalty. Evans agreed to settle the charges by admitting his offer and sale of unregistered securities and without admitting or denying the SEC's remaining allegations. The SEC intends to add money received from Evans to the Fair Fund established in this matter to distribute to harmed investors.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Geoffrey Gettinger, Michael Flanagan and Margaret Vizzi, and was supervised by Ivonia Slade and Melissa Hodgman.\u00a0The litigation was conducted by David Nasse, Derek Bentsen, Michelle Zamarin, Geoffrey Gettinger, Michael Flanagan and Kenneth Donnelly.

Va. filed July 19, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Virginia Man in Fraudulent \"Free-Riding\" Scheme\n\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it charged Chadd L. Evans of Fincastle, Virginia, with conducting a fraudulent \"free-riding\" scheme in which he attempted to profit by purchasing and selling stocks without paying for them.\n\nThe SEC's complaint states that, from July 2020 to October 2020, Evans engaged in a pattern of making bogus transfers of money from various under-funded bank and brokerage accounts to new accounts at other broker-dealers, knowing that he did not have sufficient funds to cover the transfers. The complaint further alleges that Evans immediately began trading securities in the newly opened brokerage accounts using funds the brokerage firms made temporarily available while the fraudulent transfers were pending. When those transfers did not materialize, the brokerages were left with trading losses. According to the complaint, Evans perpetrated this scheme at a series of five brokerage firms, made false deposits totaling over $280,000, and placed nearly $1 million in trades. Evans's trading was not profitable, leaving the brokers with the losses he incurred on those trades.\n\nEvans, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, which would permanently enjoin him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment would also enjoin Evans from opening any brokerage account without first providing the brokerage firm with a copy of the SEC's complaint and final judgment in this matter, and would require that he pay a $10,000 civil penalty.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Jack Easton under the supervision of Kingdon Kase and Scott A.

Legendary Partners, LLC and Scott L. Snyder, No. 23-cv-01282 (C.D. Cal. filed July 18, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Legendary Partners, LLC and its President with Reality TV Offering Fraud Targeting Mostly Elderly Investors\n\nSEC Seeks Court Approval for Settlement that Includes Antifraud Injunctions, Officer and Director Bar, and Monetary Relief\n\n\n\nThe SEC today charged California-based Legendary Partners, LLC and its founder and President Scott L. Snyder with conducting a nationwide offering fraud that raised approximately $391,000 from April 2018 to December 2021.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the Complaint, the offering was pitched as an opportunity to invest in a start-up company that purportedly would produce a reality-television series about the refurbishment of damaged exotic and luxury vehicles.\u00a0 According to the Complaint, Legendary Partners and Snyder solicited investors using \u201ccold callers\u201d\u2014including Snyder who nearly always concealed his true identity when interacting with investors by using the alias \u201cBill Miller\u201d\u2014located in Orange County, California.\u00a0 The SEC alleged that the cold callers would contact the mostly elderly investors by phone and routinely provide baseless and misleading profit projections designed to entice investors.\n\nThe SEC alleged that Snyder also intentionally misdirected money to Legendary Partners from several other investors who intended to invest in different and unrelated offerings.\u00a0 According to the Complaint, instead of investing the money as promised, Snyder instead tricked these investors into depositing their money into accounts controlled by Legendary Partners.\u00a0 The SEC alleges that this money was then misappropriated by Legendary Partners and Snyder.\n\nThe SEC also filed and sought court approval for a settlement.\u00a0 Legendary Partners and Snyder consented to the entry of a final judgment that would permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, prohibit Snyder from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security (provided, however, that such injunction would not prevent him from purchasing or selling securities for his own personal account), and impose an officer-and-director bar against Snyder. \u00a0\n\nThe final judgment, if approved by the court, would hold Snyder liable for payment of $42,636 in disgorgement plus $9,956 in prejudgment interest, as well as a $50,000 civil penalty. \u00a0In addition, the final judgment, if approved by the court, would order Legendary Partners to pay $184,706 in disgorgement plus $43,130 in prejudgment interest, as well as a $184,706 civil penalty.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Retail Strategy Task Force and Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00a0 Investors can also use the SEC\u2019s SALI database to find information about certain people who have had judgments or orders issued against them in SEC court actions or administrative proceedings. \n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Carolyn Kurr, Michael Grimes, and Shipra Wells, with the assistance of trial attorney Dean Conway, and was supervised by C. Joshua Felker and Melissa Hodgman.\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

James P. Anglim, Civil Action No. 1:23-cv-11598 (D. Mass. filed July 17, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Former Broker-Dealer Representative in Connection with Fraudulent Scheme to Manipulate Stock Prices\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged New Jersey resident and former broker-dealer registered representative, James P. Anglim, who from November 2016 to February 2022, helped facilitate market manipulation schemes involving the sale of stock in at least five public companies by other persons at manipulated prices.\u00a0 Anglim has agreed to settle the case by, among other things, paying $488,000. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s Complaint filed in federal court in Boston, Anglim was employed as a registered representative of two different United States-based brokerage firms that engaged in \u201cmarket-making\u201d activities, which involve a brokerage firm providing liquidity to the securities markets by publicly quoting both a buy price and sell price for stocks and offering to trade with the public at those prices.\u00a0 According to the Complaint, Anglim abused his position as a trader in order to facilitate the illegal sale of stock into the public securities markets by other persons who controlled large blocks of stock in at least five different public companies.\u00a0 Anglim\u2019s conduct helped those other persons to dump large quantities of stock into the public markets while concealing that they were the source of all of those sales, thus avoiding disclosure requirements imposed by the federal securities laws.\u00a0 The Complaint alleges that the other persons, who have been previously charged with fraud by the Commission, were not customers of the brokerage firms where Anglim was employed.\u00a0 Nonetheless, as alleged in the Complaint, Anglim entered into repeated arrangements with them whereby he agreed to assist them with stock transactions in a way that benefitted Anglim and allowed the other persons to carry out their fraud. The Complaint alleges that sometimes the other persons stoked artificial demand for the stocks through stock promotions using aggressive sales communications or boiler rooms, which resulted in retail investors purchasing the stock on the basis of the manipulated price and volume information.\u00a0\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Anglim has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; orders him to pay disgorgement of $405,991, representing his trading profits, and $82,009 in prejudgment interest, and imposes a penny stock bar against Anglim.\u00a0 Based on his cooperation with the Commission\u2019s investigation, the Commission determined not to seek a civil penalty in its settlement with Anglim, and has asked the court not to impose a penalty.\u00a0 The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by William Donahue, Kathleen Shields, Edward Janowsky, Ryan Murphy and Robert Baker of the SEC\u2019s Boston Regional Office.\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Celsius Network Limited and Alexander \"Alex\" Mashinsky, No. 1:23-cv-06005 (SDNY filed July 13, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Celsius Network Limited and Founder Alex Mashinsky with Fraud and Unregistered Offer and Sale of Securities\n\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission charged Celsius Network Limited (Celsius) and its founder and former CEO, Alex Mashinsky, for violating registration and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including by failing to register the offers and sales of Celsius's crypto lending product, the Earn Interest Program; making false and misleading statements to investors of the Earn Interest Program and Celsius's own crypto asset security, CEL; and engaging in market manipulation as it relates to CEL.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, from almost the inception of Celsius in 2018 to the point the company effectively halted its platform on June 12, 2022, Celsius offered to investors the Earn Interest Program, by which investors tendered their crypto assets to Celsius in exchange for interest payments. As alleged, although the Earn Interest Program constituted the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws, no registration was filed or in effect for the offering, and no exemption from registration was available. As a result, the Earn Interest Program lacked the protection that registration would offer.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, throughout its operating period, Celsius and Mashinsky continually misrepresented core aspects of Celsius's business to Earn Interest Program and CEL investors, including making false and misleading statements about trading and business strategies, risks, the company's business model, its financial health and success, and the safety of customer assets on Celsius's platform.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that Celsius and Mashinsky manipulated the market of CEL. Starting in at least 2020, according to the complaint, Celsius and Mashinsky engaged in a fraud to artificially increase and support the price of CEL through manipulative buy backs of CEL far in excess of its publicly disclosed purchases. As alleged, Celsius and Mashinsky - the single largest holder of CEL other than Celsius - structured the scheme to have the greatest impact on the market and induce others to buy CEL, to the benefit of Celsius and Mashinsky.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the Southern District of New York, charges Celsius and Mashinsky with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 9(a)(2) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's complaint seeks injunctions against future securities law violations and an injunction that prohibits Mashinsky from participating, directly or indirectly, in the purchase, offer, or sale of any crypto asset securities or engaging in activities for the purposes of inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any crypto asset securities by others. The complaint also seeks to bar Mashinsky from acting as an officer or director of a public company and seeks monetary relief in the form of civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, and prejudgment interest.\n\nCelsius is cooperating with the SEC and has consented to the relief requested in the complaint, which includes a permanent injunction against future securities law violations.\n\nIn parallel actions, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced charges against Mashinsky and a non-prosecution agreement with Celsius, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced charges against Celsius and Mashinsky.\n\nThe SEC's ongoing investigation is being conducted by Randall D. Friedland and Christian J. Ascunce, with the assistance of Sachin Verma, Peter Rosario, and Adam Gottlieb. The matter is being supervised by Pei Y. Chung and Stacy L. Bogert, as well as David Hirsch and Jorge G. Tenreiro of the SEC's Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. The litigation is being led by H.B.

Cooper J. Morgenthau, Civil Action No. 1:23-cv-00022 (S.D.N.Y. filed Jan. 3, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Former SPAC CFO for Orchestrating $5 Million Fraud Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it obtained a final judgment in a previously-filed case against Cooper J. Morgenthau, the former CFO of African Gold Acquisition Corp., a SPAC or special purpose acquisition company, for orchestrating a scheme in which he stole more than $5 million from the company and from investors in two other SPACs that he incorporated.\n\n\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in January 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleged that, from June 2021 through July 2022, Morgenthau embezzled money from African Gold and stole funds from another SPAC series called Strategic Metals Acquisition Corp. I and II to pay for his personal expenses and to trade in crypto assets and other securities.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Morgenthau concealed unauthorized withdrawals by falsifying African Gold\u2019s bank account statements and then provided those falsified documents to African Gold\u2019s auditor and accountants for purposes of preparing African Gold\u2019s SEC filings. During the same general time period, Morgenthau raised money from Strategic Metals\u2019 investors based on misrepresentations that the money would be used to launch the Strategic Metals SPACs, when in fact Morgenthau misappropriated the money for personal uses, including to conceal his embezzlement of African Gold\u2019s funds.\n\nOn July 13, 2023, the court entered a final judgment ordering Morgenthau to pay disgorgement of $5,111,335, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $221,237, deemed satisfied by the amounts of restitution and forfeiture ordered in a parallel criminal case filed against Morgenthau.\u00a0 Previously, Morgenthau consented to the entry of a judgment on January 6, 2023, enjoining him from violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2(a) and (b), and 13a-14 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company.\n\nOn January 3, 2023, Morgenthau pled guilty to criminal charges brought by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York.\u00a0 On April 27, 2023, Morgenthau was sentenced to 36 months in prison, plus 36 months of supervised release, and ordered to forfeit $5,111,335 and to pay restitution of $5,111,335.\n\n\nFor further information, see Litigation Release No. 25605.\u00a0Judgment\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Joseph Michael Todd, et al., No. 5:23-cv-00431 (M.D. Fla. filed July 12, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Former Florida Brokerage Representative with Defrauding Senior and Disabled Customers\n\n\n\n\nOn July 12, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed partially settled charges against Joseph Michael \"Mike\" Todd, a resident of Panama City, Florida, and his entities Todd Financial Services, LLC (\"TFS\") and TFS Insurance Services LLC (\"TFS Insurance\"), for defrauding at least 20 brokerage customers of at least $3 million.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, Todd, while employed as a registered representative and investment adviser representative at a dually-registered broker-dealer and investment adviser, obtained investor funds through deceptive means by instructing his brokerage customers to write checks payable to TFS, TFS Insurance, or Todd by falsely assuring customers that he and his entities would invest the customers' funds in various securities. As alleged, Todd instead misappropriated investors' funds and kept the money for his own personal use, spending it on real estate, boating, hunting, casinos, and adult entertainment. The complaint further alleges that, in order to conceal and continue his scheme, Todd presented defrauded customers with forged account statements or portfolio holdings statements that contained falsified entries indicating the customers were invested in the products promised by Todd. Many of the victims of Todd's scheme were seniors and/or disabled individuals, the complaint alleges. According to the complaint, Todd also made Ponzi-like payments to at least one customer by using other customers' funds to make regular deposits from a TFS bank account into this customer's account, which he falsely claimed were interest payments or regular distributions on an investment.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the Middle District of Florida, charges Todd and TFS with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Todd, TFS, and TFS Insurance with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's complaint seeks disgorgement, civil penalties, permanent injunctions, and conduct-based injunctions stemming from the Defendants' wrongdoing, and a permanent officer-and-director bar against Todd.\n\nTo settle the Commission's charges, Todd, TFS, and TFS Insurance, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, have consented to the injunctive relief and the officer-and-director bar for Todd, and to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the Court at a later date upon an SEC motion.\n\nThe SEC's investigation, which is ongoing, was conducted by Caryn Trombino, Larry Brannon, Neal Jacobson, and Ellen Lynch, and supervised by Jeffrey Shank of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Daniel Hayes.\n\nThe SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Costello et al., No. 2:22-cv-01388 (W.D. Wash., filed Sept. 29, 2022)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Microcap Stock Promoter\n\u00a0\n\nOn July 11, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a final judgment against defendant David Ferraro for his role in alleged microcap stock promotion schemes that generated more than $140,000 in profits for Ferraro.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from at least October 2019 through January 2021, Ferraro and his co-defendant Justin Costello engaged in a stock promotion scheme in which Ferraro recommended and promoted to his Twitter followers and the public at least five microcap stocks that Costello owned, without disclosing that he and Costello intended to sell shares of those stocks as their prices rose, or that Costello would pay Ferraro a portion of his profits from some of those sales. Costello shared approximately $32,000 of his profits with Ferraro, and Ferraro profited approximately $41,000 from his own trading in this scheme. The SEC\u2019s complaint also alleged that Ferraro separately conducted his own stock promotion scheme respecting two additional microcap stocks, generating profits of approximately $68,000.\n\nFerraro previously consented to a bifurcated settlement and consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to be permanently enjoined from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and from participating in any offering of a penny stock. The final judgment against Ferraro awards the previously imposed injunctive relief and penny stock bar; orders Ferraro to pay disgorgement in the amount of $142,724.97, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $11,704.92, for a total of $154,429.89; and does not impose a civil penalty, based on Ferraro\u2019s sworn statement of financial condition.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation is being conducted by Pascale Guerrier of the Miami Regional Office and Samuel Kalar and Tian Wen of the New York Regional Office, under the supervision of Celeste A.

On June 16, 2023, the Court entered final judgments on consent against two other defendants in the case, Nikola Faukovic and Catherine DeFrancesco.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 6, 2023, Andrew DeFrancesco was the \"chief architect of the scheme\" in which the false filings, including misstatements and omissions about a critical business relationship, masked Cool Holdings' perilous financial condition and future prospects. The complaint further alleges that Andrew DeFrancesco and others arranged for the publication of a series of fraudulent promotional articles about Cool Holdings that Andrew DeFrancesco secretly funded. In addition, according to the complaint, with Faukovic's assistance, Andrew DeFrancesco secretly sold hundreds of thousands of Cool Holdings shares, which he held in the name of nominee entities. Andrew DeFrancesco and his ex-wife Catherine DeFrancesco allegedly concealed his ownership of Cool Holdings shares, including by filing false beneficial ownership reports with the SEC.\n\nAndrew DeFrancesco consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1(a) and 16a-3 thereunder. The final judgment ordered him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,276,070.49, and a civil penalty of $1,737,224.52. Andrew DeFrancesco was also barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.\n\nFaukovic consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining her from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $14,350.32, and a civil penalty of $111,614. Catherine DeFrancesco consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining her from violating Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-1(a) thereunder, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $122,782.\n\nThe SEC's litigation against defendants Marlio Mauricio Diaz Cardona and Carlos Felipe Rezk continues, and is being conducted by David Stoelting, Alexander Levine, Mao Yu Lin, and Melissa Coppola of the New York Regional Office; Jason Schall of the Home Office; and Katherine Bromberg and Danielle Srour of the Retail Strategy Task Force.

Empires Consulting Corp., et al., No. 22-cv-21995-CMA (S.D. Fla. filed June 30, 2022)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgments Against Operators of Fake Trading Scheme Known as \"EmpiresX\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has obtained final judgments against Empires Consulting Corp. (\"EmpiresX\"), and its founders Emerson Sousa Pires and Flavio Mendes Goncalves, whom the agency charged with a fake trading scheme.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed June 30, 2022, Pires and Goncalves operated a purported hedge fund known as EmpiresX. Since at least late 2020, EmpiresX sold investments touting daily profits of one percent earned by a trading \"bot\" or by manual trading. The complaint alleges that, in reality, the bot was fake, the manual trading resulted in significant losses, and the defendants only transferred a small portion of investors' funds to EmpiresX's brokerage account. Instead, the defendants allegedly misappropriated large sums of investors' money to lease a Lamborghini, shop at Tiffany & Co., make a payment on a second home, and make other personal expenditures.\n\nPires and Goncalves were also charged criminally for their alleged conduct in a parallel criminal proceeding, United States v. Emerson Sousa Pires, et al., 22-CR-20296-JEM (S.D. Fla.). They are currently fugitives.\n\nThe judgment against Pires and Goncalves, entered on the basis of default on June 21, 2023 by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, permanently enjoins Pires and Goncalves from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also permanently enjoins them from, directly or indirectly, soliciting any new investors or accepting additional funds from existing investors, and issuing, purchasing, offering, or selling any security; provided, however, that such injunction shall not prevent them from purchasing or selling securities for their own personal accounts. In addition, Pires and Goncalves are barred from acting as officers or directors of a public company. The judgment orders Pires and Goncalves to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $32,179,070, plus prejudgment interest of $2,661,610. The judgment also imposes civil penalties of $6,000,000 on Pires and $5,000,000 on Goncalves.\n\nSeparately, EmpiresX consented to a final judgment, which was entered on May 22, 2023. The judgment orders similar injunctive relief, and orders EmpiresX to pay, jointly and severally with Pires and Goncalves, disgorgement of $32,178,397, plus prejudgment interest of $2,661,554, with its obligation to pay deemed satisfied by the amounts collected by a state-court-appointed receiver.\n\nThe SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tEmpiresX Judgment\n\tPires and Goncalves Judgment\n\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    EmpiresX Judgment\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Pires and Goncalves Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Juan Roman, No. 1:23-cv-11470 (D. Mass. filed June 30, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Former Pharma Employee with Insider Trading\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Juan Roman with insider trading in advance of public announcements concerning two drugs under development at Acceleron Pharma Inc. \u00a0At the time of the alleged trading, in 2019 and 2020, Acceleron was a publicly-traded Massachusetts-based biopharmaceutical company, and Mr. Roman was its Senior Director of Market Access. Roman, who was responsible for planning the marketing and sale of Acceleron\u2019s drugs once they achieved approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has agreed to settle the charges and pay more than $200,000.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Roman traded Acceleron securities based upon material nonpublic information that he had learned about the company achieving key milestones concerning two different drug candidates. As alleged in the complaint, on December 6, 2019, Roman traded Acceleron stock and options during a securities trading blackout window and in advance of positive news regarding the company\u2019s application to the FDA for approval to market and sell its anemia drug Reblozyl for a particular use and generated profits of $1,637. Just a month later, on January 23 and 24, 2020, Roman allegedly traded Acceleron options in advance of the company\u2019s announcement of positive clinical trial results for Sotatercept, a drug being developed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. The SEC contends that Roman placed these January 2020 trades during another securities trading blackout window and generated profits of $96,115.\u00a0\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Roman has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; orders him to pay disgorgement of $97,752, representing his total trading profits, $15,224.22 in prejudgment interest, and a $97,752 civil penalty; and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Andrew Palid and Michele T.

Tex. filed June 30, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Five Individuals in Penny Stock Fraud Scheme \u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filed today a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas charging five individuals with a fraudulent scheme to sell millions of shares of Global Resource Energy, Inc. (OTC: GBEN), a Fort Worth-based microcap company. \u00a0The defendants collectively received approximately $1.7 million in proceeds from the fraudulent scheme. \u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that Thomas Collins and Patrick Thomas obtained undisclosed control over the vast majority of GBEN\u2019s shares, and then coordinated with Brian Kingsfield, Scott Levine, and Gary Kouletas to fraudulently sell GBEN shares to the investing public. \u00a0According to the complaint, Collins and Thomas used sham consulting agreements to transfer millions of restricted shares of GBEN stock to a third party to give the appearance that the shares were freely tradeable. \u00a0Collins and Thomas, with the assistance of Kingsfield and a network of salespeople, induced investors to purchase the GBEN shares. \u00a0To assist in the fraudulent scheme, Collins enlisted Levine, a market maker, to help match unsuspecting public investors with sellers of shares secretly controlled by Collins and Thomas. \u00a0In addition, the SEC alleges that Collins and Thomas used another sham consulting agreement to transfer millions of restricted GBEN shares to an entity owned by Kouletas. \u00a0The Kouletas entity then sold those shares, and split the proceeds with Collins and Thomas. \u00a0\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charges all defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder and Sections 17(a)(1) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), and Kingsfield with violating Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act for acting as an unregistered broker. \u00a0The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against all defendants, along with officer-and-director bars against Collins and Thomas. \u00a0The defendants have agreed to consent to all the charges and relief, and their settlements are subject to court approval.\nEach of the defendants has pleaded guilty in parallel criminal proceedings in the Northern District of Ohio. See United States v. Collins, et al., 1:20-cr-00842-BYP (N.D. Ohio); see also United States v. Levine, 1:23-cr-00262-SL (N.D. Ohio). \u00a0Collins was sentenced to 41 months imprisonment, Thomas to 18 months imprisonment, Kouletas to 43 months imprisonment, Kingsfield to 37 months imprisonment, and Levine is awaiting sentencing. \u00a0\n\nIn a separate proceeding, Damon Durante, another salesperson Collins and Thomas used to sell GBEN shares, consented to a cease-and-desist order finding that he willfully violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act for acting as an unregistered broker. \u00a0Durante agreed to an order of disgorgement, civil penalty, penny stock bar, and an industry bar. \u00a0Durante also pleaded guilty in the parallel criminal proceeding and was sentenced to six months imprisonment. \u00a0See United States v. Collins, et al., 1:20-cr-00842-BYP (N.D. Ohio). \u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Derek Kleinmann and Ty Martinez, and supervised by Sarah S. Mallett and Eric R. Werner of the SEC\u2019s Fort Worth Regional Office. \u00a0The SEC\u2019s litigation is being conducted by Matthew J. Gulde and supervised by B.

Robert D. Christensen, Anthony M. Matic, Foresee, Inc., The Commission PDX, LLC, The Policy PDX, LLC, Innings 150, LLC, No. 3:23-cv-00959 (D. Or. filed June 30, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Two Oregon Residents and Their Related Entities with $10 Million Ponzi-Like Scheme\n\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Oregon residents Robert D. Christensen and Anthony M. Matic, as well as several companies they controlled, with conducting a multi-year Ponzi-like scheme and misleading investors who purchased more than $10 million in promissory notes.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, from at least January 2018 through September 2022, Christensen and Matic used four entities that they founded - Foresee Inc., The Commission PDX LLC, The Policy PDX LLC, and Innings 150 LLC - to raise money from retail investors, including several retirees, for the purported purpose of investing in real estate. Christensen and Matic allegedly raised this money through the offer and sale of unregistered promissory notes, which promised high interest rates between nine and 15 percent to be paid to investors, in addition to the return of all principal, within just a few months. In reality, the complaint alleges, Christensen and Matic did not have the ability to pay investors the promised returns within the time periods identified in the notes; instead, they relied on new investor money to pay earlier investors. Additionally, Christensen and Matic allegedly used investor money for unauthorized and undisclosed purposes, including to pay for at least one vacation, gifts, casino trips, massages, personal expenses, a whiskey club membership, and cryotherapy.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, charges Christensen and Matic and their related entities with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Christensen, Matic, and the charged entities agreed to settle with the SEC and to the entry of final judgments imposing requested permanent and conduct-based injunctions as well as $5,374,482 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. Christensen and Matic further agreed to each pay a $200,000 penalty as well as to the imposition of permanent officer and director bars. The settlements are subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Steven Varholik and Michael Foley, with the assistance of Marc Katz and Bernard Smyth, of the San Francisco Regional Office. The investigation was supervised by Jason H. Lee and David Zhou.\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n            Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Leon Vaccarelli, et al., No. 3:17-cv-01471 (D. Conn., filed Aug. 31, 2017)\n\nUnited States v. Leon Vaccarelli, No. 18-cr-92-SRU (D. Conn., filed May 2, 2018)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Former Broker and Investment Adviser Charged with Fraud\n\n\n\n\nOn June 29, 2023, the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut entered a final judgment against Leon Vaccarelli (d/b/a LUX Financial Services) and his company, LWLVACC, LLC, for fraudulently persuading several customers to invest with him and then spending their money on his own living and business expenses.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in 2017, alleged that Vaccarelli defrauded at least nine investors, several of whom were elderly, of over $1,000,000. The SEC alleged that instead of investing the customers' funds in investment accounts and other investment opportunities as promised, Vaccarelli used the funds for his own living and business expenses. In some instances, Vaccarelli allegedly used the customers' funds to pay back prior investors. Vaccarelli also allegedly asked one customer to sign an agreement that she would not provide certain information to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or the SEC. The SEC further alleged that Vaccarelli sold more than $450,000 in securities that were held in trust for a beneficiary and used some of the proceeds to pay business and personal expenses.\n\nOn May 29, 2019, after an 11-day criminal trial, a jury convicted Vaccarelli of securities fraud and other charges arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC's complaint. On October 30, 2020, Vaccarelli was sentenced to 90 months incarceration, followed by three years of supervised release. On December 23, 2020, he was ordered to pay restitution of $1,456,632. Vaccarelli currently is incarcerated in federal prison in Massachusetts.\n\nOn June 29, 2023, the court entered a final judgment in the SEC's case permanently enjoining Vaccarelli and LWLVACC from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 21F-17(a), and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering Vaccarelli to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest totaling $1,518,941, offset by the amount of restitution ordered in the parallel criminal case.\n\nFor further information, see Litigation Release Nos. 23927 (August 31, 2017), 24140 (May 14, 2018), and 24495 (June 10, 2019).\n\n\n\tJudgment\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Brian H. Casutto, Matthew J. Zucco, and Kevin R. Harris, CPA, No. 2:23-cv-05104 (C.D. Cal. filed June 27, 2023)\n\n\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission v. Ryan C. Drexler, No. 2:23-cv-05102 (C.D. Cal. filed June 27, 2023)\n\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday filed a settled complaint charging Las Vegas-based nutritional supplement company MusclePharm Corp.'s former Executive Vice President of Sales and Operations, Brian H. Casutto, former Vice President of Sales, Matthew J. Zucco, and former contract Chief Financial Officer, Kevin R. Harris, for engaging in improper revenue recognition practices to achieve revenue growth demanded by its former Chief Executive Officer, Ryan C. Drexler. The SEC also separately charged Drexler with fraud in a litigated complaint for disclosure violations and control failures.\n\nThe SEC's settled complaint alleges that Casutto, with the assistance of Zucco, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to prematurely recognize revenue for orders that remained in MusclePharm's control. The complaint further alleges that Harris should have known that MusclePharm prematurely recognized certain revenue and that MusclePharm overstated other revenue by misclassifying customer credits as advertising expenses rather than as reductions to revenue. The defendants' misconduct allegedly inflated the company's publicly reported quarterly revenues by as much as 25 percent and gross profits by as much as 49 percent.\n\nThe SEC's complaint against Drexler alleges that, while CEO, he misled investors about the catastrophic impact of the company's default with institutional noteholders and that he falsely certified that he evaluated the company's internal controls.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Casutto, Zucco, and Harris have each consented to the entry of judgments, subject to court approval, which permanently enjoin Casutto and Zucco from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Harris from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933.\u00a0 The proposed judgments also enjoin defendants from violating or aiding and abetting issuer violations of additional books and records, control, reporting, and proxy solicitation provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13b2-1 (Casutto, Zucco, Harris); Section 13(b)(5) (Casutto, Zucco); Section 14(a) and Rules 14a-3 and 14a-9 (Casutto, Harris); and Section 13(b)(2)(B) and Rule 13a-15(a) (Harris). The proposed judgments require Casutto and Zucco to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest of $79,760.01 and $15,033.06, respectively; require Casutto and Harris to pay a civil penalty of $207,183 and $50,000, respectively, and reserve the issue of Zucco's civil penalty for further determination by the court; and bar Casutto from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.\n\nThe SEC charged Drexler with violating and/or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\u00a0 The complaint also charges Drexler with violating the reporting, control, and proxy solicitation provisions of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-14, 13a-15(b)-(c), 14a-3, and 14a-9 thereunder, as well as with aiding and abetting MusclePharm's reporting and control violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 13a-15(a) thereunder.\u00a0 In addition, Drexler is being charged with violating the clawback provision of Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX\"). The complaint seeks injunctive relief, civil penalties, reimbursement to MusclePharm under SOX 304(a), and an officer and director bar.\n\nBoth complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Jennifer Turner and Michael D'Angelo and supervised by Mary Brady, Nicholas Heinke, and Jason Burt. The litigation is being led by Zachary Carlyle and Sharan Lieberman and supervised by Mr. Burt, Mr. Heinke, and Gregory Kasper.\n\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint - Casutto, Zucco, and Harris\n\tSEC Complaint - Drexler\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n             SEC Complaint - Casutto, Zucco, and Harris\n  \n\n              \n            SEC Complaint - Drexler\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

(\u201cVuuzle US\u201d), UAE entity Vuuzle Media Corp Limited (\u201cVuuzle UAE,\u201d and with Vuuzle US, \u201cVuuzle\u201d), and U.S. citizens Ronald Shane Flynn and Richard Marchitto. \u00a0Vuuzle, Flynn, and Marchitto were previously charged with fraudulently raising over $25 million from investors across the United States as part of a boiler room scheme.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s amended complaint alleged that between 2016 and 2022, Vuuzle and Flynn raised more than $25 million from investors using a boiler room of salespeople based primarily in the Philippines and employing high-pressure tactics.\u00a0 According to the amended complaint, Vuuzle and Flynn promised investors that Vuuzle was a legitimate and growing company and a \u201cpre-IPO\u201d investment opportunity, when in fact Vuuzle had never made a profit and had never made a public offering on any stock exchange.\u00a0 As alleged, only a small fraction of investor funds went towards the online streaming business, with the remainder misappropriated to sustain the boiler room, to pay commissions to Flynn and others, and to pay Flynn and Marchitto\u2019s personal and business expenses. \u00a0The amended complaint alleged that Flynn and Vuuzle continued their fraud after the commencement of the SEC\u2019s lawsuit by, among other things, offering a \u201cVUCO security token\u201d and falsely promising the tokens would substantially increase in value if investors exchanged their Vuuzle shares for tokens.\u00a0 The amended complaint alleged that Marchitto facilitated the fraudulent scheme by maintaining a U.S. bank account, corporate credit cards, and a New York office address for Vuuzle, and that he opened new accounts after the SEC\u2019s lawsuit commenced.\n\nThe judgments, entered on the basis of default, permanently enjoin Flynn, Vuuzle US, Vuuzle UAE, and Marchitto from violating the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\u00a0 The judgments also permanently enjoin Vuuzle US, Vuuzle UAE, and Flynn from violating the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act; Marchitto from aiding and abetting violations of these sections; and Flynn from violating the broker/dealer registration provisions of Section 15 of the Exchange Act.\u00a0 Flynn, Vuuzle US, and Vuuzle UAE were jointly and severally ordered to pay disgorgement of $25,807,490.73 and pre-judgment interest of $720,354.08.\u00a0 Marchitto was ordered to pay disgorgement of $464,819 and pre-judgment interest of $12,974.31.\u00a0 The Court further imposed the following civil monetary penalties:\u00a0 $25,807,490.73 (Flynn); $31,080 (Marchitto); and $1,035,909 each (Vuuzle US and Vuuzle UAE).\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation was conducted by Devon Staren, Daniel Maher, and Drew Grossman, under the supervision of Jim Connor and Olivia Choe.\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u00a0\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Richard J. Rubin and Thomas J. Craft, Jr., No. 20-civ-10084 (S.D.N.Y. filed December 2, 2020)\n\n\n\nSEC Settles Case Against Two Former Lawyers For Scheme to Create False Opinion Letters\n\n\n\nOn June 26, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments against Richard J. Rubin and Thomas J. Craft, Jr., two former attorneys, in a civil action in which the SEC charged them for their role in a fraudulent legal opinion letter scheme to facilitate the sale of millions of shares of microcap securities to retail investors. The final judgments resolve the SEC\u2019s case against Rubin and Craft.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleged that from December 2015 to July 2018, Rubin, who was disbarred in 1995, continued to fraudulently practice securities law by submitting at least 128 attorney opinion letters that allowed microcap stock issuers\u2019 securities to be purchased by and sold to the investing public. The complaint alleged that Rubin signed certain letters, falsely claiming to be an attorney, and that he drafted other letters for Craft\u2019s signature. The complaint alleged that Craft signed or permitted the use of his name and signature on at least 30 letters that falsely stated he had performed substantive work to formulate the opinions in those letters. The SEC\u2019s complaint charged Rubin and Craft with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n\nRubin and Craft were charged criminally by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, and each pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud. Rubin was sentenced on November 2, 2021, and received one-year probation, forfeited $117,068.15, and was ordered to pay a $1,000 monetary penalty and perform 200 hours of community service. Craft was sentenced on October 27, 2022 to four months of home confinement and one-year probation, forfeited $55,000, and was ordered to perform 200 hours community service.\u00a0 He also agreed to the surrender of his law license.\n\nRubin and Craft consented to the entry of separate final judgments in the SEC action, permanently enjoining each of them from violating the Securities Act and Exchange Act antifraud provisions and ordering penny stock bars.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation and investigation teams included Hane L. Kim and Michael Paley, and the litigation was supervised by Sheldon Pollock of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York and the Office of the Inspector General of the SEC.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Ichioka with $25 Million Offering Fraud\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission charged William K. Ichioka, of New York, New York, with fraudulently raising $25 million from individual investors primarily in California and Oregon by making false claims about his investing success and promising large anticipated returns but instead using investor funds for gambling and to enrich himself. Ichioka has agreed to resolve the charges against him.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, from at least June 2019 to October 2021, Ichioka solicited investments for his unregistered investment fund, Ichioka Ventures, by claiming he was an accomplished investor, promising oversized returns, and guaranteeing investors' principal. In reality though, as the complaint alleges, Ichioka was unable to pay investors the promised returns and used money from new investors to repay other investors. Also, as alleged in the complaint, Ichioka falsified a bank statement and other documents to create an appearance of success. Finally, according to the complaint, Ichioka also misappropriated millions of investors' funds for personal use, such as on luxury watches, cars, gambling, and a penthouse apartment.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Ichioka with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Ichioka has agreed to the entry of a partial final judgment, subject to court approval, imposing requested permanent and conduct-based injunctions as well as an officer and director bar, and reserving issues of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty for further determination by the court.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California (USAO) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also announced charges against Ichioka.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Erin E.

Infinity Q Capital Management, LLC, No. 23-civ- 05081 (S.D.N.Y. filed June 16, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Infinity Q Investment Adviser with Fraud; Seeks Monitor to Oversee Return of Remaining Funds to Harmed Investors of the Infinity Q Private Fund\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled action against registered investment adviser Infinity Q Capital Management, LLC for mispricing the net asset value, or \"NAV,\" of its public mutual fund and private fund as part of a massive overvaluation scheme. The SEC's complaint seeks an order appointing a monitor to oversee the return of remaining funds to harmed private fund investors. The SEC previously charged the mutual fund with mispricing its NAV, and the court appointed a special master to oversee the distribution of the mutual fund's remaining funds to its harmed investors.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, from at least February 2017 through February 2021, the mutual fund's and hedge fund's reported NAVs were materially and falsely inflated due to a fraudulent mismarking scheme conducted by Infinity Q through its Chief Investment Officer, James Velissaris. The SEC previously charged Velissaris for his role in the scheme.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Infinity Q with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; the antifraud, books and records, and reporting provisions of Sections 204(a), 206(1), 206(2), 206(4) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204-2(a), 206(4)-7, and 206(4)-8 thereunder; and the reporting provisions of Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\"Investment Company Act\"). It also charges Infinity Q with aiding and abetting the mutual fund's violation of the pricing provisions of Rule 22c-1 under the Investment Company Act. Infinity Q has agreed to settle the charges and consent to the appointment of the monitor. The settlement, which permanently enjoins Infinity Q from violating the federal securities laws charged in the Complaint, and the appointment of the monitor, are subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's ongoing investigation is being conducted by Zachary B. Sturges of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit, Ariana J. Torchin and Brian Fitzpatrick of the Asset Management Unit, and Kerri Palen, Preethi Krishnamurthy, James Addison, and Neal Jacobson of the New York Regional Office. It is being supervised by Andrew Dean, Co-Chief of the Asset Management Unit, Osman Nawaz, Chief of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit, Joshua Brodsky, Assistant Regional Director of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit, and Alistaire Bambach, Assistant Regional Director of the New York Regional Office and Chief Bankruptcy Counsel to the Division of Enforcement.

Fla. filed June 16, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Convertible Note Dealer and Its Owner for Failure to Register\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against a convertible note dealer, BHP Capital NY, Inc., and its managing member, Bryan Pantofel, for failing to register with the SEC as securities dealers. As part of the settlement, Pantofel and BHP Capital agreed to pay more than $2.5 million in monetary relief and have BHP Capital surrender for cancellation the securities it allegedly obtained from its unregistered dealer activity.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that, between December 2017 and mid-2022, BHP Capital purchased more than 100 convertible notes and associated warrants from 47 microcap issuers, and converted the notes into approximately four billion newly issued shares of stock at a large discount from the market price. It then allegedly sold the newly issued shares into the market at a significant profit. As alleged, neither BHP Capital nor Pantofel was registered as a dealer with the SEC or associated with a registered dealer, as their activities required them to be.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, BHP Capital and Pantofel agreed to be permanently enjoined from further violations of Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $2,353,073.44 and a civil penalty of $200,000, and to five-year penny stock bars. BHP Capital also agreed to surrender all conversion rights in its currently held convertible notes, surrender for cancellation all unexercised warrants that it acquired in connection with convertible notes, and surrender for cancellation any shares it holds that were acquired by converting notes or exercising related warrants. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Cecilia B. Connor and Matthew B. Homberger in the Philadelphia Regional Office, assisted by Robert Nesbitt, and supervised by Kingdon Kase and Scott A. Thompson. The litigation will be led by Karen M. Klotz and supervised by Gregory R.

Bahgat\n\n\n\nA federal district court in the Western District of New York entered a final judgment by default against Tarek D. Bahgat, an investment adviser formerly based in Amherst, New York.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleged that Bahgat misappropriated over $378,000 from seven of his investment advisory clients. The SEC alleged that Bahgat illicitly obtained internet access to some of his clients' brokerage accounts by impersonating, or having his co-defendant, Lauramarie Colangelo, impersonate Bahgat's clients during telephone calls with broker-dealers holding the clients' accounts. This enabled Bahgat to cause money to be transferred from the clients' account to Bahgat and to his company, relief defendant WealthCFO, LLC. The SEC's complaint charged Bahgat with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"). The complaint sought permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties from Bahgat.\n\nThe SEC obtained a default judgment against Bahgat after he didn't respond to the Commission's complaint. On June 6, 2023, the Court enjoined Bahgat from violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act; ordered Bahgat to disgorge $378,021.97; $142,057.43 in prejudgment interest; and imposed a civil penalty of $378,854.00 pursuant to Section 209(e) of the Advisers Act.\n\nFinal judgments have previously been entered against defendant Colangelo and relief defendant WealthCFO.\n\nFor further information, see Litigation Releases No. 23951 (Sept. 29, 2017), No. 24192 (July 10, 2018), and No. 24284 (Sept. 21, 2018).\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Chimene Van Gundy, Outstanding Real Estate Solutions, Inc., Michael Trofimoff, Santos Kidd, and Maria Tosta, No. 5:23-cv-700 (W.D. Tex. filed May 31, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Self-Proclaimed 'Queen of Mobile Homes' and Three Salespeople with Fraud in Mobile Home Investment Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filed today a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas charging Outstanding Real Estate Solutions, Inc. (ORES), its Chief Executive Officer and founder Chimene Van Gundy, and salespeople Michael Trofimoff, Santos Kidd, and Maria Tosta for their roles in raising approximately $18.5 million from at least 600 investors through a fraudulent mobile home investment scheme.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, between at least June 2018 and November 2021, Van Gundy, the self-proclaimed \"Queen of Mobile Homes,\" and her company, ORES, raised millions from investors while promising to use the funds to purchase, refurbish, and resell mobile homes. The complaint alleges that Van Gundy and ORES did not actually own hundreds of mobile homes that they claimed ORES purchased with investor funds. Rather than using investor funds as promised, the complaint alleges that Van Gundy and ORES made Ponzi-like payments to existing investors, paid undisclosed sales commissions, and funded Van Gundy's personal expenses. The complaint also alleges that Van Gundy, Trofimoff, Kidd, and Tosta acted as unregistered brokers, and made false and misleading statements or omissions to investors while offering and selling ORES mobile home investments.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charges ORES and Van Gundy with violating the securities-registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). The complaint further charges ORES, Van Gundy, Trofimoff, and Kidd with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charges Tosta with violating Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and Van Gundy, Trofimoff, Kidd, and Tosta with violating the broker-registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against all defendants, and an officer-and-director bar against Van Gundy. Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Tosta has agreed to settle the charges against her, consenting to the entry of a final judgment that orders permanent injunctions, disgorgement and pre-judgement interest totaling $117,917.57, and a civil penalty of $60,000. Tosta\u2019s settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation, which is ongoing, was conducted by Kendrack Lewis and Melvin Warren of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office, under the supervision of Sarah S. Mallett and Eric R. Werner. The SEC's litigation will be led by Matthew Gulde and supervised by B. David Fraser.

Engler, et al., No. 1:20-cv-01625 (E.D.N.Y. filed Mar. 31, 2020)\n\n\n\nSEC Settles IIIicit Trading Case Against Two Former Registered Representatives\n\n\n\nOn May 18, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered final judgments against Joshua W. Turney and Hector Perez, former registered representatives at New York broker-dealer Global Arena Capital Corp., in a civil action in which the SEC alleged that they conducted an unauthorized trading scheme. The final judgments resolve the SEC's case against Turney and Perez.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleged that from April through June 2015, defendants Jonah Engler, Barbara Desiderio, Turney, and Perez fraudulently schemed to conduct large-scale trading in certain Global Arena customer accounts without receiving authorization from those customers. The defendants' illicit trading allegedly took place in over 360 customer accounts, generated over $2.4 million in unlawful profits for Global Arena and ill-gotten gains for the defendants, and resulted in over $4 million in net losses for their customers. The SEC's complaint charged Turney and Perez with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.\n\nTurney and Perez were charged criminally by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, and each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Turney was sentenced to two years' imprisonment followed by two years' supervised release, ordered to pay $5,295,868.12 in restitution, jointly and severally with Perez, and to forfeit $281,914. Perez was sentenced to two years' probation, ordered to pay $5,295,868.12 in restitution, jointly and severally with Turney, and to forfeit $137,275.\n\nTurney and Perez consented to the entry of separate final judgments in the SEC action. Turney was ordered to pay disgorgement of $347,019.13 and prejudgment interest of $81,297.47. Perez was ordered to pay disgorgement of $137,275.26 and prejudgment interest of $32,159.94. The payments were deemed satisfied by the restitution order for Turney and the restitution and forfeiture orders for Perez, in the respective parallel criminal proceedings.\n\nThe Court in the SEC action previously entered partial consent judgments against Turney and Perez, permanently enjoining each of them from violating the Securities Act and Exchange Act antifraud provisions. For further information, see Litigation Release No. 24874 (Aug. 25, 2020). The SEC also recently concluded its litigation against Engler and Desiderio.\n\nThe SEC's litigation and investigation teams included Richard Primoff, Margaret Spillane, Jacqueline Fine, Hane L. Kim, and Steven G. Rawlings, all of the New York Regional Office, and Sandra Yanez of the Home Office. The litigation was supervised by Sheldon Pollock of the New York Regional Office.

The final consent judgments conclude the SEC's case against Hydrogen, Kane, and Ostern for their roles in effectuating the unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities called \"Hydro\" and perpetrating a scheme to manipulate the trading volume and price of those securities, which yielded more than $2 million for Hydrogen. Among other relief, the settlement requires Hydrogen and Kane to pay almost $3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan in September 2022, starting in January 2018, Kane and Hydrogen, a New York-based financial technology company, created its Hydro token and then publicly distributed the token through various methods. After distributing the token, Kane and Hydrogen hired South Africa-based Moonwalkers, a self-described \"market making\" firm, in October 2018, to create the false appearance of robust market activity for Hydro through the use of Moonwalkers's customized trading software and then sold Hydro into that artificially inflated market for profit on Hydrogen's behalf.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hydrogen and Kane consented to the entry of final judgments that resolve all claims and permanently enjoin them from violating the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the market manipulation provisions of Section 9(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, and Section 20(b) of the Exchange Act. The judgments also ordered conduct-based injunctions and various undertakings. Hydrogen was ordered to pay disgorgement of $1,516,703.53 with prejudgment interest of $244,531.98 and a civil penalty of $1,035,000, and Kane was ordered to pay disgorgement of $45,818.79 with prejudgment interest of $7,387.25 and a civil penalty of $207,000, and was prohibited from acting as a director or officer of a public company.\n\nThe court previously entered a judgment by consent against Ostern on September 29, 2022, permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 9(a)(2), 10(b), and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, prohibiting him from participating in future securities offerings, and ordering him to pay $36,750 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $5,118, with civil monetary penalties to be determined at a later date by the court. As part of the settlement, Ostern has consented to a final judgment that does not impose civil monetary penalties as a result of his cooperation with the SEC's investigation, thereby making the terms of that September 2022 judgment final.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Sonia G. Torrico and Kathleen Hitchins, and it was supervised by Paul Kim, Joseph Sansone, and Carolyn M. Welshhans. The SEC's litigation was led by Nick Margida and supervised by James Connor and Olivia Choe.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Francis Sabo, No. 4:23-cv-01935 (S.D. Tex. filed May 25, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Additional Social Media Influencer in Stock Manipulation Scheme\n\n\n\nOn May 25, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission brought partially settled charges against Francis Sabo (also known as \"Ricky Bobby\") in a $100 million securities fraud scheme in which Sabo, along with several other defendants previously charged by the Commission in December 2022, used social media platforms to manipulate exchange-traded stocks.\n\nAccording to the SEC, since at least January 2020, Sabo promoted himself as a trustworthy stock-picking guru and cultivated a substantial following in the Atlas Trading forum on Discord, a free online forum purporting to provide educational content about trading and securities markets. The SEC contends that Sabo, like the previously charged defendants, purchased certain stocks and then encouraged his substantial social media following to buy those selected stocks by, among other things, posting price targets or indicating he was buying, holding, or adding to his stock positions. However, as the complaint alleges, when share prices and/or trading volumes rose in the promoted securities, Sabo regularly sold his shares without ever having disclosed his plans to dump the securities while he was promoting them. The SEC further alleges that from at least January 2020 through December 2022, Sabo made over $1 million from his participation in the stock manipulation scheme.\n\nSabo is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. To settle the Commission's charges, Sabo has consented to be enjoined from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, with the amount of monetary remedies to be determined at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval. Criminal charges against Sabo were also filed in a parallel action brought by the Criminal Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas.\n\nThe SEC's investigation, which is ongoing, is being handled by Andrew Palid, David Scheffler, and Michele T. Perillo of the Market Abuse Unit (MAU) in the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from Darren Boerner of the MAU, Stuart Jackson, Kathryn Schumann-foster and Marina Martynova of the Division of Risk and Economic Analysis (DERA), and Howard Kaplan of the Office of Investigative and Market Analytics. The investigation has been supervised by MAU Chief Joseph G. Sansone. The investigation resulted from a referral from the Division of Examinations by Mark A. Gera, John Kachmor, Nitish Bahadur, and Raymond Tan in the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by David D'Addio and Amy Burkart of the Boston Regional Office.\n\nThe SEC appreciates the assistance of the Criminal Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Deng agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a final judgment that requires him to pay $44,706 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, a $90,000 civil penalty, and bars him from acting as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleged iFresh, Inc., a public issuer, repeatedly filed materially inaccurate financial statements that failed to fully disclose related party transactions from August 10, 2016 through August 13, 2020 that were related to Deng. During that time iFresh failed to properly disclose numerous transactions with entities related to Deng and his brother. iFresh's financial statements were allegedly materially misstated in the each of the years 2016 through 2020. In addition, between 2017 and 2020, from 18% to 54% of iFresh's accounts receivable allegedly were from undisclosed related party transactions. The complaint further alleged that between 2016 and 2020, iFresh failed to disclose over $12 million in payments to a company owned by Deng's brother. Finally, the complaint alleged that by misrepresenting information about iFresh's related party transactions, iFresh deprived investors of the true scope of iFresh and Deng's intertwined business interests.\n\nDeng, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, consented to the entry of a final judgment in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, or from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.

GPL Ventures LLC, et al., No. 21-CV-6814 (S.D.N.Y. filed Aug. 13, 2021)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgments Against Stock Promoter and Microcap Issuer in Penny Stock Fraud Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission obtained final judgments against a stock promoter and a microcap issuer for their roles in an $11 million penny stock fraud scheme first charged in August 2021.\n\nOn May 23, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Eleazar Kauderer, a professional stock promoter, for his role in the scheme. The SEC's complaint, filed on May 17, 2023, alleged that, from 2017 through 2019, Kauderer conducted a fraudulent promotional campaign for shares of HempAmericana, Inc., a struggling microcap issuer, funded by the company's largest investor while it was selling shares into the market. Kauderer allegedly acted as a middleman and hired other \"downstream\" promoters to conceal the stock purchaser's contemporaneous stock sales and role as the ultimate source of funding for the promotions.\n\nOn May 2, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment on default against HempAmericana. The SEC's complaint against HempAmericana and others, filed on August 13, 2021, alleged that, from 2017 through 2019, HempAmericana schemed with the largest investor in the company's Regulation A stock offerings to use a significant percentage of the offering proceeds to secretly promote the stock so that the investor could sell its shares at a profit. The promotions funded by HempAmericana did not disclose the source of the funding, or the investor's intent to sell stock during the promotions. HempAmericana allegedly further misled the public by failing to disclose in offering circulars filed with the Commission that a significant percentage of its Regulation A offering proceeds would be used for stock promotion.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Kauderer consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also imposed a five-year penny stock bar and ordered Kauderer to pay $888,012 in disgorgement and $23,782.74 in prejudgment interest. Due to Kauderer's significant cooperation, no penalty was sought.\n\nThe final judgment against HempAmericana, entered on default, enjoined the company from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n\nThe SEC has separately obtained final judgments against four other participants charged in the August 2021 complaint. Those judgments, amongst other relief, enjoined each defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Brenda Wai Ming Chang, John C. Lehmann, Peter A. Lamore, and Adam S. Grace, and the litigation, which remains ongoing against other defendants, is being handled by Paul G. Gizzi, Ms. Chang, and Mr. Lehmann.

Levin, from Dallas-Fort Worth, with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint filed on May 9, 2023, Levin solicited investors to purchase approximately $2.6 million worth of units in a fund he controlled, the CRP Fund, which in turn owned units in funds run by GPB Capital. Levin allegedly violated the requirements of the broker-dealer registration provisions by soliciting those funds from at least 27 investors from 2017 through 2018, without being registered. The complaint further alleges that Levin was required to register with the SEC and maintain a brokerage license, which he failed to do.\n\nThe complaint, filed in the Northern District of Texas, charges Levin with violating Section 15(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Levin, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to a bifurcated settlement, agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provision, with monetary relief in an amount to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the SEC. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Shannon Keyes and Lindsay S. Moilanen of the SEC's New York Regional Office, and was supervised by Sheldon L.

Antar, who the SEC previously charged with defrauding investors, many of whom were his friends and acquaintances in a Syrian Jewish community in New Jersey.\n\nThe SEC's s complaint, alleged that Antar, of New York, New York, engaged in a fraudulent scheme that deceived numerous investors out of more than $550,000 while claiming he would invest in shares of companies that were not yet public, and then sell those shares to already-identified buyers for a premium in a short period of time. In reality, according to the complaint, Antar never used investor funds to purchase shares of emerging companies, or to make any other investment. Instead, Antar spent investor funds gambling, making gifts to family members, paying for his daughter's wedding, and making Ponzi-like payments to some early investors.\n\nThe final judgment permanently enjoins Antar from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also orders Antar to pay disgorgement of $567,000 and prejudgment interest of $88,754, with offsets permitted for amounts Antar pays pursuant to a restitution order in a parallel criminal action.\n\nIn a parallel criminal action, the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General Division of Criminal Justice filed criminal charges against Antar. On April 22, 2022, Antar pled guilty to certain of the charges and on December 9, 2022, was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay restitution of $15,000.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    SEC Complaint\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Chicago Crypto Capital LLC, et al., No. 1:22-cv-04975 (N.D. Ill. filed Sept. 14, 2022)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Default Judgments Against Unregistered Brokers for Conducting a Fraudulent and Unregistered Offering of Crypto Asset Securities\n\n\n\nOn May 10, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered final judgments against Chicago Crypto Capital LLC (\"CCC\"), its owner, Brian Amoah, and former salesman Elbert \"Al\" Elliott, whom the SEC previously charged with violations of the federal securities laws.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, from August 2018 through November 2019, CCC, Amoah, and Elliott acted as unregistered brokers and conducted an unregistered offering of BXY tokens, illegally raising at least $1.5 million in proceeds from approximately 100 individuals, many of whom had no experience investing in crypto assets. The complaint alleged that each of the defendants made materially false and misleading statements in the offer, purchase, and/or sale of BXY tokens, including about the custody and delivery of BXY, the markup charged by CCC, the delivery of account statements, CCC's liquidation of an investor's BXY, their personal investments in BXY, and the financial and management problems occurring at BXY's issuer, Beaxy Digital Ltd., in late 2019. The complaint further alleged that some of these investors never received their BXY tokens, and all those who invested paid an undisclosed markup on their BXY tokens.\n\nThe judgments, entered on the basis of default, enjoin CCC, Amoah, and Elliott from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 15(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgments also permanently enjoin CCC, Amoah, and Elliott from participating, directly or indirectly, including, but not limited to, through any entity they control, in any offering of crypto asset securities; provided, however, that such injunctions shall not prevent them from purchasing or selling any crypto asset security for their own personal accounts. In addition, Amoah is barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company. The judgments order Amoah and CCC to pay jointly and severally disgorgement of $935,599.65, plus prejudgment interest of $136,087.10; and Elliott to pay disgorgement of $21,777.64, plus prejudgment interest of $3,167.66. The judgments also impose civil penalties of $1,339,368 on CCC, $245,553 on Amoah, and $133,938 on Elliott.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Peter Senechalle and Devlin N. Su, with assistance from Craig McShane, and was supervised by Amy Flaherty Hartman, of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. Robert M. Moye and Messrs. Senechalle and Su led the litigation.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Judgment - Brian Amoah\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Judgment - Elbert Elliott\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Callahan managed and made the investment decisions for the five funds through his two investment advisory entities and received inflated management fees. Callahan misused investor assets to pay certain other investors seeking redemptions and for personal expenses, and improperly diverted assets of the funds to Manson's private real estate project on Long Island. Manson and his entities, Distinctive Investments, LLC and Distinctive Ventures, LLC, created a paper trail of inflated false promissory notes and false audit confirmations that helped Callahan conceal the scheme.\n\nWithout denying the SEC's allegations, Callahan, Manson, Distinctive Investments and Distinctive Ventures consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. On March 9, 2013, Callahan's investment advisory entities and offshore funds also were enjoined from violating antifraud provisions. A Court-appointed receiver in the SEC's action and criminal authorities in a parallel criminal action collected and distributed to harmed investors over $51 million.\n\nIn 2014, Callahan and Manson pled guilty to securities fraud charges in the criminal action, United States v. Brian R. Callahan and Adam Manson, Crim. No. 13-453-GRB (E.D.N.Y.). In 2017, Callahan was sentenced to 12 years in prison followed by three years of supervised release and ordered to pay restitution of more than $67 million. In October 2022, Manson was sentenced to two years in prison and one year of supervised release, and he paid, forfeited, and surrendered rights to certain monies.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was conducted by Dean M. Conway, Lisa Deitch, Ashley Sprague and Holly Yoshinari and was supervised by Stacy Bogert and James Connor.\n\nSee Litigation Release Nos.

Quanta, Inc., et al.;, ivil Action No. 2:23-cv-03683 (C.D. Cal. filed May 15, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Microcap Company and Its Executives with Fraud\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Quanta, Inc., a Burbank, California-based biopharmaceutical company that develops and sells a scorpion venom product called Escozine, its CEO, Arthur Mikaelian, and his son and Quanta's executive vice president in charge of operations, Grant Mikaelian, have agreed to settle fraud charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint. As part of the settlement, the Mikaelians consented to officer and director bars and to pay civil penalties.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, in a July 23, 2021 press release, Quanta and Arthur Mikaelian misrepresented the FDA staff's response to the company's proposed clinical trial of Escozine as a Covid-19 treatment. As the complaint alleges, the press release misrepresented that the FDA staff's response validated the clinical study conducted in the Dominican Republic and that the FDA's staff had recognized the potential therapeutic benefits of Escozine. The complaint further alleges that these, and additional false and misleading statements in the press release, gave investors the impression that the FDA's staff was positive about the proposed clinical trial and the results of its clinical trials in the Dominican Republic. However, as alleged in the complaint, the FDA staff's response stated that the Dominican Republic clinical trial \"cannot be directly leveraged to support your proposed clinical trial\" and that antiviral activity \"has not been demonstrated with your specific product, [E]scozine.\"\n\nIn addition, the SEC's complaint alleges that Quanta included $198,000 of improperly recognized revenue in its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2021, causing Quanta to overstate its total revenue by 61% in that quarter. The SEC's complaint alleges that Quanta based its improper revenue recognition on a backdated purchase order created by Grant Mikaelian for its Escozine immunapens, which it also provided to Quanta's auditors as support for its revenues. The SEC's complaint further alleges that Arthur Mikaelian falsely represented in a management representation letter to Quanta's auditor that the quarterly financials were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and he certified Quanta's first quarter Form 10-Q, which included the $198,000 in revenue.\n\nQuanta, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, consented, pre-filing, to the entry of a final judgment which permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal controls provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.\n\nArthur and Grant Mikaelian, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, consented, pre-filing, to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining each of them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder, respectively. In addition, Arthur and Grant Mikaelian each consented, pre-filing, to five-year officer and director bars and five-year penny stock bars, and civil penalties of $150,000 and $75,000, respectively.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Junling Ma and Lorraine Pearson under the supervision of Victoria Levin and Rhoda Chang, with the assistance of trial counsel Donald Searles under the supervision of Gary Leung.

(\"CodeSmart\"). The SEC alleged that Bell and another individual invested their brokerage customers in CodeSmart, including a number of elderly customers. The SEC alleged that the plan was for the defendants, including Bell, to profit at the expense of Bell's customers. Bell allegedly personally sold his CodeSmart shares at the same time as purchasing shares in his customers' accounts.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charged Bell with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. On December 22, 2022, the Court entered a partial judgment against Bell by consent in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions and agreed to a penny stock bar. On May 5, 2023, the Court entered a final judgment against Bell by consent in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions. He agreed to disgorge $552,725 in ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest thereon, the payment of which was deemed satisfied by the restitution order in the parallel criminal proceeding, United States v. DiScala, et al., 14 Cr. 399 (E.D.N.Y.).\n\nThe SEC's litigation is being handled by Todd Brody and Lindsay Moilanen of the New York Regional Office and is being supervised by Sheldon L.

(\"ASNT\"). In February 2017, Gillespie caused ASNT to issue 200,000 shares of common stock to another defendant, as payment for \"consulting services\" which were then sold onward to a different defendant. The SEC alleged that in August 2017, the group entered into a second transaction in which Gillespie caused ASNT to issue to a defendant a convertible promissory note. The group agreed that once the stock reached their target price of $5.00 per share, the defendant holding the shares would begin selling them and that the group would then split the proceeds.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charged Gillespie with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. On July 11, 2022, the Court entered a bifurcated consent judgment against Gillespie enjoining him from violating the charged provisions and imposing a penny stock bar and officer and director bar. On April 25, 2023, the Commission informed the Court that it did not intend to seek further relief, thereby resolving the litigation as to Gillespie.\n\nThe SEC's litigation is being handled by Christopher Dunnigan, Christine Ely, and Lindsay Moilanen of the New York Regional Office and is being supervised by Sheldon L.

Joshua David Nicholas, et al., No. 22-cv-21995-CMA (S.D. Fla. filed June 30, 2022)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Head Trader Charged in Fake Trading Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has obtained a final judgment against a head trader at \u201cEmpiresX,\u201d which the agency charged with a fake trading scheme.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed June 30, 2022, Joshua David Nicholas was the head trader of a purported hedge fund known as EmpiresX that was operated by co-defendants Emerson Sousa Pires and Flavio Mendes Goncalves. Since at least late 2020, EmpiresX sold investments touting daily profits of one percent earned by a trading \u201cbot\u201d or Nicholas\u2019 manual trading. The complaint alleges that, in reality, the bot was fake, Nicholas\u2019 trading resulted in significant losses, and the defendants only transferred a small portion of investors\u2019 funds to EmpiresX\u2019s brokerage account. Instead, the defendants allegedly misappropriated large sums of investors\u2019 money to lease a Lamborghini, shop at Tiffany & Co., make a payment on a second home, and more.\n\nNicholas, Pires, and Goncalves were also charged criminally for their alleged conduct in a parallel criminal proceeding, United States v. Joshua David Nicholas, et al., 22-CR-20296-JEM (S.D. Fla.). Nicholas pled guilty and was sentenced to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $3,379,527.18 in restitution. Pires and Goncalves are currently fugitives.\n\nThe final judgment against Nicholas, entered on April 19, 2022 by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, enjoins Nicholas from violating Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n\nThe SEC appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Judgment\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

RRBB Asset Management, LLC, et al., Civil Action No. 2:20-cv-12523 (D.N.J. filed September 10, 2020)\n\n\n\nSEC Announces Entry of Final Judgment Against President of Maplewood, New Jersey-Based Investment Adviser For Operating a Cherry-Picking Scheme\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on May 9, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against Carl S. Schwartz, the president, co-owner and managing member of RRBB Asset Management, LLC.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s complaint, filed on September 10, 2020, alleged that from at least August 2016 through April 2017, RRBBAM and Schwartz engaged in a fraudulent trade allocation or \u201ccherry-picking\u201d scheme in breach of their fiduciary duties to their advisory clients. According to the complaint, Schwartz traded securities in RRBBAM\u2019s omnibus trading account and delayed allocating the securities to specific client accounts until he had observed the securities\u2019 performance over the course of the day.\u00a0 He allegedly then allocated favorable trades (i.e., trades that had a positive first day return) to accounts held by a new client, who was one of RRBBAM\u2019s largest and most lucrative clients in terms of assets under management, while disproportionately allocating a number of unfavorable trades (i.e., trades that had negative first day returns) to six accounts associated with two elderly widows, including a charitable foundation of which Schwartz was a trustee. The complaint alleged that through this scheme, RRBBAM and Schwartz earned substantial management fees and made misrepresentations in RRBBAM\u2019s brochures and other disclosures in which they claimed trades would be fairly and equitably allocated among all client accounts.\u00a0 \n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Schwartz consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoined him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and aiding and abetting violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder.\u00a0 The final judgment also ordered Schwartz to pay disgorgement of $50,000.00, prejudgment interest of 13,754.13, and a civil penalty of $100,000.00. \u00a0Pursuant to the stipulation of the parties, RRBBAM was dismissed from the action as it has ceased operations, has no assets, and has withdrawn its registration with the Commission as an investment adviser.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Matthew Montgomery and supervised by Robert Conrrad, with assistance from Eugene Orlov and Raymond Wolff in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation was led by Donald Searles and supervised by Gary Leung, with\u00a0 assistance from Erin Smith and Eugene Canjels in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

IRB Brasil Resseguros S.A.,Civ. Action, No. 1:23-cv-03905 (S.D.N.Y. filed May 9, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Settles Fraud Charges Against Brazilian Reinsurance Company\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that IRB Brasil Resseguros S.A., a publicly-traded Brazilian reinsurance company, agreed to a civil injunction to settle charges that the company had planted a false story with the media and disseminated false documents in order to influence IRB\u2019s stock price.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, in February 2020 after a significant decline in IRB\u2019s stock price following a short seller\u2019s report questioning IRB\u2019s financial results, IRB and its former executive vice president of finance and investor relations, Fernando Passos, spread a fabricated story that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. had recently invested in IRB. The complaint alleges that IRB, through Passos, created and shared a fake shareholder list that showed Berkshire had made substantial purchases of IRB stock. The complaint further alleges that IRB communicated the false information to analysts and investors during meetings in both the United Kingdom and the United States. According to the complaint, IRB\u2019s stock price rose by more than 6 percent following the Brazilian and U.S. media reports that Berkshire had invested in IRB and subsequently dropped by more than 40 percent after Berkshire denied that it was an investor. Following Berkshire\u2019s denial, IRB conducted an internal investigation; shared the results with SEC staff; and fully cooperated with the SEC\u2019s investigation. IRB also took extensive remedial measures, including replacing senior management; replacing and expanding its Board of Directors; and implementing processes and procedures designed to prevent this type of misconduct from occurring in the future. \u00a0\n\nIRB consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, which would permanently enjoin it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Due in part to the company\u2019s significant cooperation and remediation in this matter, the SEC did not impose a penalty as part of its settlement with the company. On April 18, 2022, the SEC charged Passos with violating the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act and is seeking civil monetary penalties, as well as an officer-and-director bar, against him. \u00a0\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Jeffrey Lyons and supervised by Ian Karpel, Nicholas Heinke, and Jason Burt of the Denver Regional Office, with the assistance of trial counsel Zachary Carlyle under the supervision of Gregory Kasper.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Clayton R. Thomas and Personalized Healthcare Solution, LLC, No. 3:23-cv-00459 (M.D. Tenn. filed May 9, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Tennessee Resident and Company with Selling Fraudulent Promissory Notes\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Brentwood, Tennessee resident Clayton R. Thomas and the now defunct entity he controlled, Personalized Healthcare Solution, LLC, with selling fraudulent promissory notes and misappropriating investor funds.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, alleges that, from February until June 2019, Thomas and Personalized Healthcare Solution raised approximately $730,000 from a single investor, telling that investor that they would purchase certain medical devices and place the devices in medical offices to generate an investment return from usage fees. In reality, according to the complaint, Thomas and Personalized Healthcare Solution overstated the purchase price of the medical devices and fraudulently inflated the medical devices' anticipated returns. The complaint also states that Thomas knew that the investment would likely be far less profitable than what he told the investor based on prior experience with a different investor in which the medical devices produced little to no return. Finally, the SEC alleges that the investor lost substantially all of its original investments, and that Thomas misappropriated investor funds for his personal use by pocketing the difference between the actual cost of the medical devices and the amount that he represented to the investor that they would cost.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Thomas and Personalized Healthcare Solution with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Thomas and Personalized Healthcare Solution each consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, and authorizing the court to determine at a later date the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties that Thomas will pay.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Justin Delfino and supervised by Peter Diskin and Justin Jeffries, all of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC's litigation will be led by Kristin Murnahan and supervised by Graham Loomis.

Kay X. Yang, et al., Case No. 2:22-CV-00450 (E.D. Wis. filed Apr. 13, 2022)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Default Judgments Against Operators of Investment Fraud Scheme Targeting Hmong-Americans\n\n\n\nOn April 26, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin granted the SEC's motion for default judgment, and entered final judgments, against defendants Kay X. Yang and Xapphire LLC, whom the SEC previously charged with violations of the federal securities laws. The court also entered a final judgment against Kay Yang's husband, Chao Yang, who the SEC charged as a relief defendant for improperly receiving proceeds from the fraudulent scheme.\n\nAccording to the SEC's amended complaint, and the court's findings, between April 2017 and April 2021, Kay Yang engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities issued by two entities she owned, AK Equity Group LLC and Xapphire Fund LLC. Yang represented to prospective investors, many of whom were members of the Hmong-American community, that she would invest their money primarily through foreign exchange trading, they could expect annual returns ranging from 20% to 50%, and that her trading was consistently successful. In reality, Yang used less than half of the investors' contributions for foreign exchange trading and had many months with large net trading losses, resulting in negative returns. In addition, Yang misappropriated approximately $4,060,000 of the investors' money to fund her and her family's lifestyle, including spending on casinos, travel, homes, and cars, and to repay investors in a previous venture.\n\nThe judgments, entered on the basis of default, enjoined Kay Yang and Xapphire LLC from violating the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In addition, Kay Yang was barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company. The judgments ordered Kay Yang and Xapphire LLC to pay, on a joint-and-several basis, $4,060,212 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest in the amount of $188,787.16, and a civil penalty in the amount of $4,060,212. Chao Yang was ordered to pay up to $830,502 in disgorgement and $38,615.75 in prejudgment interest.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was handled by Robert M. Moye and BeLinda Mathie of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office, with the assistance of Kathleen Sweeney.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Order\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

According to the complaint, the purported promissory notes never existed, and the funds raised in connection with the note were funneled to a companies owned by DeGregorio, that were created by for the sole purpose of facilitating his fraud and did not carry out any actual business activities.\u00a0 The complaint further alleged that DeGregorio did not use any of the investor money for legitimate investments, but instead misappropriated the vast majority of the funds for personal expenses and gambling.\u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint charged DeGregorio with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\u00a0 On March 18, 2022, the Court entered a bifurcated consent judgment against DeGregorio enjoining him from violating the charged provisions.\u00a0 On May 5, 2023, the Court entered a final judgment against DeGregorio by consent in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions.\u00a0 He agreed to disgorge $1,084,500 in ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest thereon, the payment of which was deemed satisfied by the restitution and forfeiture orders in the parallel criminal proceeding, United States v.

Filed May 14, 2020)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgment Against Former CEO and General Counsel Who Raised Millions of Dollars from Investors Through False Statements\n\n\n\nOn May 3, 2023, the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut entered a final judgment against former Connecticut resident Ronald D. Swanson ordering him to pay over $927,000 in disgorgement and penalties in a securities offering fraud action previously filed by the SEC in May 2020. The Court also ordered Swanson barred from serving as the officer or director of a publicly-traded company for a period of 10 years.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleged that Swanson fraudulently raised more than $2 million from investors between October 2012 and August 2015 by making false and misleading statements about Texas-based liquid purification technology company Sonic Cavitation, Inc. The complaint alleged that while serving as the chief executive officer and general counsel of Sonic Cavitation, Swanson made multiple false claims exaggerating the interest level of Sonic Cavitation's potential business partners and the capabilities of its technology, and minimizing the risk level of its investment offerings.\n\nSwanson had previously consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment in the SEC action that permanently enjoined him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder upon the entry of the final judgment by the Court. Swanson had also consented to the imposition of penalties, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a bar from serving as an officer and director of a public company, with the amounts and durations of those remedies to be determined by the Court. The judgment issued by the District Court after a hearing bars Swanson from serving as an officer or director of any public company for ten years, and finds him liable for disgorgement of $677,753, plus prejudgment interest in an amount to be determined, and a civil penalty of $250,000.\n\nThe SEC's case was handled by Rua Kelly, Marc Jones, Dawn Edick, and Amy Gwiazda of the Boston Regional Office. The civil action followed an examination in a related matter conducted by Maria Pimentel Viana and Kenneth Leung of the Boston Regional Office.

The offering materials represented that the properties would be purchased in the name of the funds in which investors had invested and that distributions to investors would come from income from the real estate. The complaint alleged that Burrell misappropriated investor money by using it to purchase properties in the name of other Activated entities for which the investors and the funds in which the investors had invested did not have an ownership interest. Burrell also allegedly used investor money to pay purported distributions to investors. The offering materials and marketing materials also included misrepresentations that one of the funds would have an outside custodian and that the Activated principals had made significant investments into that fund. Finally, Burrell also allegedly misappropriated $100,000 from investor funds, including $56,000 which he characterized as \"property improvement\" expenses.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charged Burrell and Activated with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. On January 25, 2022, the Court entered bifurcated consent judgments against Burrell and Activated enjoining them from violating the charged provisions. On April 28, 2023, the Commission informed the Court that it did not intend to seek monetary remedies as to Activated, thereby resolving the litigation as to the entity. On May 1, 2023, the Court entered a final judgment against Burrell by consent in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions. He agreed to disgorge $100,155.42 in ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest thereon, the payment of which was deemed satisfied by the restitution order in the parallel criminal proceeding, United States v. Burrell, 21 Cr. 0063 (S.D.N.Y.).\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Alison Conn, Kim Han, Lindsay S. Moilanen, Kerri Palen, and Judith Weinstock under the supervision of Thomas P. Smith, Jr. The SEC's litigation was led by Paul Gizzi.

To settle the case, the defendants consented to pay more than $39 million in civil penalties and disgorgement.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed on August 13, 2021, alleged that between July 2017 and August 2021, the defendants acted as unregistered securities dealers by privately acquiring numerous microcap stocks at a discount and subsequently publicly selling the securities to the investing public. In addition, the complaint charged the defendants with orchestrating a fraudulent scheme in which they acquired shares in microcap issuer HempAmericana, Inc. and secretly arranged for HempAmericana to use a percentage of the stock proceeds to fund stock promotions while the defendants sold their shares into the market.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay $29,681,569 in disgorgement and $2,489,799 in prejudgment interest, orders Dillon and Panait to pay civil money penalties of $3,500,000 each, directs the defendants to surrender for cancelation all remaining unconverted convertible notes still held, with a face value of approximately $11 million, and imposes five-year penny stock bars against defendants.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Brenda Chang, John C.

Colo. filed April 27, 2023) \u00a0\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Colorado Man with Fraudulently Selling Promissory Notes for Luxury Travel Business\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission charged Tyler L. Andrews for making false statements while raising over $1 million from investors in an unregistered offering of securities for a luxury travel business, Platinum Travel and Entertainment, LLC, whose owner Gregory A. Ciccone fraudulently diverted all the money raised. \u00a0The SEC previously charged Platinum and Ciccone with fraud.\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, which was filed today in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, Andrews offered to sell promissory notes to 17 investors for the represented purpose of securing hotel reservations as part of Platinum\u2019s high-end luxury travel business. \u00a0Among other things, the complaint alleges that Andrews made several false statements to investors, including that Ciccone was an impressive entrepreneur and successful businessman, when Andrews knew Ciccone was previously convicted of fraud; that the promissory notes were prepared by an attorney who conducted due diligence; and that the loans were secured by collateral. \u00a0In addition, the complaint alleges that Andrews failed to disclose that the travel concierge business was not making timely payments on the promissory notes.\n\nThe complaint charges Andrews with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act. \u00a0Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Andrews consented to permanent injunctions, $14,990 of disgorgement with prejudgment interest, a $75,000 civil penalty, and a ten-year officer and director bar. \u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Matthew L. Skidmore and supervised by Mary S. Brady, Nicholas P. Heinke, and Jason J. Burt, with the assistance of trial counsel Leslie J. Hughes under the supervision of Mr. Burt, Mr. Heinke, and Gregory A.

In connection with at least four companies, Reyes also allegedly engaged in wash trading to create the appearance of an active market and raise the company's stock price. The complaint further alleges that Reyes's fraudulent activity increased the prices of the securities he targeted and that he profited from these schemes by selling the securities at the inflated prices. As a result of these schemes, Reyes profited by $368,045.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the charges, Reyes consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 9(a)(1), 9(a)(2), and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment orders Reyes to pay disgorgement of $368,045, prejudgment interest of $76,843, and a civil penalty of $160,000. The final judgment further prohibits Reyes from acting as an officer or director of a public company, and prohibits Reyes from participating in any offering of penny stocks. Finally, the final judgment enjoins Reyes from engaging in, or deriving compensation from, specified activities related to inducing the purchase or sale of securities, unless those securities are listed on a national securities exchange and satisfy specified capitalization requirements.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Kristine Zaleskas, Ricky Tong, Jason Schall and Michael Paley, and was supervised by Thomas P.

Mass. filed June 8, 2022)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Default Judgments Against Three Defendants in an Investment Fraud Scheme Involving Penny Stock Companies\n\n\n\nOn April 25, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgments against defendants Trends Investments Inc., Leslie Greyling and Brandon Rossetti, who were previously charged by the SEC with engaging in a scheme to defraud investors in private offers and sales of shares of two publicly traded penny stock companies.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed in June 2022, Leslie Greyling and Rossetti, on behalf of Trends, allegedly lied to investors about whether Trends owned and could deliver to investors the shares it claimed to be selling. The SEC alleged that Leslie Greyling and Rossetti made a variety of misrepresentations to investors in order to keep investor funds, obtain further investments, placate investor concerns, and avoid detection. Rossetti was also charged with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer by soliciting investors, receiving transaction-based compensation from Trends, and claiming to be a \"broker\" or \"wealth manager.\" The SEC's complaint also alleged that Clinton Greyling, the son of Leslie Greyling, participated in the scheme. Additionally, according to the complaint, Roger Bendelac participated in the scheme by placing manipulative trades in one of the securities Trends was offering and selling to investors. His relative Thomas Capellini was charged with aiding and abetting Bendelac in connection with the manipulative trades.\n\nThe judgments, entered on the basis of default, enjoined Trends, Leslie Greyling and Rossetti from violating the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and imposed penny stock bars. Further, Rossetti was enjoined from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer. The judgments ordered Trends and Leslie Greyling to pay on a joint-and-several basis $1,774,747 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $361,798. Trends was ordered to pay a $2,232,280 penalty and Leslie Greying a $446,458 penalty. Rossetti was ordered to pay $797,750 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest in the amount of $172,676, and a $446,458 penalty.\n\nOn September 23, 2022, the court entered a judgment against Clinton Greyling, who without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and imposing a penny stock bar. The judgment left disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date. Litigation continues with respect to Bendelac and Capellini.\n\nThe SEC's case is being handled by David M. Scheffler, Nita Klunder, J.

SAExploration Holdings, Inc., et al., No. 1:20-CV-08423 (S.D.N.Y. filed Oct. 8, 2020)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment from Former Executive for His Role in $100 Million Accounting Fraud\n\n\n\nOn April 21, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgment against Jeffrey Hastings for his role in a multi-year accounting fraud engaged in while he was CEO of Houston-based seismic data company SAExploration Holdings, Inc. (SAE). The SEC's amended complaint alleges that Hastings and three other former SAE executives falsely inflated the revenue of SAE by approximately $100 million and concealed their theft of millions of dollars from the company.\n\nAccording to the SEC's amended complaint, Hastings, along with his co-defendants, caused SAE to enter into a series of seismic data acquisition contracts totaling approximately $140 million with a purportedly unrelated Alaska-based company that was in fact controlled by Hastings and co-defendant Brent Whiteley. The amended complaint alleges that SAE improperly recorded approximately $100 million in revenue in light of the Alaskan company's inability to pay and the SAE executives' control of the company. As also alleged, Hastings and his co-defendants misappropriated $12 million from SAE and routed approximately half of those funds back to SAE to create the false impression that the related Alaskan company was actually paying SAE for seismic data, and then kept the remainder of the misappropriated funds for themselves.\n\nWithout denying the SEC's allegations, Hastings consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, and 13a-14 thereunder, and Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX\"). The final judgment also orders Hastings to pay $1,116,987.27 in disgorgement plus $194,835.52 in prejudgment interest, for a total of $1,311,822.79, which shall be deemed satisfied by the Order of Restitution entered against Hastings in the criminal case of United States v. Hastings, No. 1:20-cr-534-GHW-1 (S.D.N.Y.). Hastings was also ordered to reimburse SAE $1,206,626 pursuant to Section 304(a) of the SOX.\n\nOn December 17, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final consent judgment against SAE.\n\nThe SEC's ongoing litigation against other defendants is being conducted by Nick Margida, Peter Lallas and Yael Berger, and supervised by James Connor.\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n    Final Judgment - Jeffrey A.

Blakstad, and Energy Sources International Corporation (\u201cESI\u201d), which was a purported cryptocurrency mining operation controlled by Blakstad. \u00a0On December 7, 2022, the Court entered an amended final judgment against Xact Holdings Corporation (\u201cXact\u201d), a company that also was controlled by Blakstad.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint, between at least July 2015 and May 2019, Blakstad fraudulently raised money from investors through Midcontinental Petroleum, Inc. (\u201cMPI\u201d), a purported oil, gas, and alternative energy resources company, as well as through ESI and Xact. \u00a0Rather than use investors\u2019 funds as represented, the SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that Blakstad treated the company bank accounts as his own personal piggybank.\n\nBlakstad was charged criminally by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York. \u00a0On June 8, 2021, Blakstad was convicted at trial of: \u00a0(1) conspiracy to commit securities fraud; (2) securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (3) conspiracy to commit wire fraud; (4) wire fraud; and (5) aiding and abetting. \u00a0Blakstad was sentenced to 36 months of imprisonment; three years of supervised release; criminal forfeiture of $4,518,103; restitution of $669,000; and an assessment of $700. \u00a0\n\nBlakstad consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, imposes an officer and director bar, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest relating to each the following aspects of the fraud:\n\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MPI: \u00a0Disgorgement of $669,000, plus prejudgment interest of $49,250 (deemed satisfied by orders of restitution and forfeiture in United States v.

Blakstad, a self-employed individual from San Diego. On November 21, 2022, the Court entered final judgments against Robert J. Maron, a personal friend of Blakstad, and Martha Patricia Bustos, a former accountant at Illumina, Inc. and close friend of Blakstad.\n\nAccording to the SEC's amended complaint, Bustos tipped Blakstad material, nonpublic information concerning at least four different Illumina quarterly performance announcements. Blakstad enlisted two individuals to trade on his behalf ahead of two of the announcements, and also tipped Maron and at least three other individuals, each of whom traded in advance of at least one of the announcements. After receiving the tip, Maron purchased out-of-the-money, near-expiration Illumina put option contracts in an account owned by his friend Joubin Torkan, which generated $900,000 in unlawful profits for Maron and $113,833 for Torkan. Torkan previously settled the SEC's relief defendant claims against him, agreeing to disgorge $113,833 and to pay prejudgment interest of $8,606, which the Court approved on September 29, 2021.\n\nBlakstad and Bustos were both charged criminally by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. On June 8, 2021, Blakstad was convicted at trial of: (1) conspiracy to commit securities fraud; (2) securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; (3) conspiracy to commit wire fraud; (4) wire fraud; and (5) aiding and abetting. The Court sentenced Blakstad to 36 months of imprisonment; three years of supervised release; criminal forfeiture of $4,518,103; restitution of $669,000; and an assessment of $700.\n\nBustos pleaded guilty to (1) securities fraud; (2) conspiracy to commit securities fraud; and (3) conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The Court sentenced her to time served, two years of supervised release, criminal forfeiture of $12,000, a criminal fine of $20,000, and 250 hours of community service.\n\nIn the SEC action, both Blakstad and Bustos have consented to the entry of judgments enjoining them from violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Blakstad was ordered to pay disgorgement of $3,639,784, plus prejudgment interest of $188,068. Bustos was ordered to pay disgorgement of $12,000. For each, the monetary judgments were deemed satisfied by the orders of forfeiture against them in the criminal matters.\n\nMaron consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and ordering that he pay a civil penalty of $1,800,000.\n\nAdditionally, on April 17, 2023, the Commission entered an administrative order suspending Bustos from appearing or practicing before the Commission pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice based on her criminal conviction.\n\nBlakstad also was charged and agreed to settle the securities fraud charges against him in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Blakstad, et al., Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-00163 (S.D.N.Y., filed January 8, 2020), as described in the litigation release for that case.\n\nThe litigation was led by Christopher R.

Moon for improperly offering investment advisory and brokerage services, predominately to African-American investors of the Christian faith.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint alleges that, from at least 2020 to 2021, Moon \u2013 an insurance agent and registered representative of an SEC-registered broker-dealer \u2013 through Increase Financial Strategies LLC and Faith Financial Strategies, two companies he owned and controlled, entered into brokerage agreements and engaged in trading activity with investors, without his employer\u2019s knowledge or consent. \u00a0As alleged in the complaint, Moon stated that he was a \u201cfinancial services professional\u201d who held \u201cvarious registrations in the financial services space\u201d and portrayed Increase Financial as a brokerage services firm.\u00a0 The SEC alleges that, in fact, Moon was neither authorized by his employer, nor licensed by FINRA, to purchase or sell common stock for others. \u00a0As alleged in the complaint, Moon entered into brokerage agreements with nine investors, and with their consent accessed their online brokerage accounts and conducted hundreds of trades. \u00a0Moon\u2019s trading resulted in approximately $31,800 in losses to investors, who collectively paid Moon $3,000 in fees for his services.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges Moon with violating the registration provisions of Section 15(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. \u00a0The complaint also charges Moon with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. \u00a0Moon has consented, without admitting or denying the allegations, to an injunction, disgorgement of $3,000 with $158 in prejudgment interest, a $31,080 civil penalty, plus post judgment interest.\u00a0 The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00a0\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was part of the Miami Regional Office\u2019s Fraud Against Minority Groups Initiative and was conducted by Paul Hopker and Hughens Dolisca in the Miami Regional Office and supervised by Jason R.

Engler, et al., No. 1:20-cv-01625 (E.D.N.Y. filed Mar. 31, 2020)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains More Than $5 Million in Final Judgments Against Two Defendants in IIIicit Trading Scheme\n\n\n\nOn April 12, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered final judgments against defendants Jonah Engler and Barbara Desiderio in an ongoing civil action in which the SEC alleges that Engler, Desiderio and two other defendants conducted a fraudulent, unauthorized trading scheme through hundreds of retail customer accounts at New York broker-dealer Global Arena Capital Corp. Engler, who allegedly controlled Global Arena and directed the scheme, was ordered to disgorge $1,440,683.51 in ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $420,561.71, and to pay a civil penalty of $2,295,977.90. Desiderio was ordered to pay $391,000 in disgorgement, $114,140 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $391,000.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, filed on March 31, 2020 against Engler, Desiderio, Joshua Turney, and Hector Perez, alleged that the defendants engaged in illicit trading in over 360 retail customer accounts as Global Arena was going out of business, which resulted in over $4 million in net losses for their customers and generated over $2.4 million in unlawful markups, markdowns, and commissions for their firm. The SEC\u2019s complaint charged Engler with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and charged Desiderio with aiding and abetting her co-defendants\u2019 violations.\n\nThe Court previously entered partial consent judgments against Engler and Desiderio, permanently enjoining them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Based on the entry of those judgments, the SEC also previously issued orders barring Engler and Desiderio from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock. For further information, see Litigation Releases No. 24874 (Aug. 25, 2020) and No. 25221 (Sept. 24, 2021).\n\nThe SEC\u2019s litigation, which continues as to Turney and Perez, is led by Richard Primoff, Margaret Spillane, Jacqueline Fine, Hane L. Kim, and Steven G. Rawlings, and is supervised by Sheldon Pollock of the New York Regional Office.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

North, the former Chief Credit Officer of Wilmington Trust.\n\nIn 2015, the SEC charged North and three other former Wilmington Trust officers with fraud for their roles in Wilmington Trust making false or misleading public statements and omissions regarding its loan portfolio, including its underreporting, by hundreds of millions of dollars, its real estate loans which were 90 days or more past due. The SEC's complaint further alleged that North violated and/or aided and abetted violations of the federal securities laws in connection with false and misleading statements concerning the credit quality of certain of Wilmington Trust's loans.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, North consented to the entry of a judgment that enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and further enjoins him from aiding and abetting future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. The judgment further orders North to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement resolves the SEC's case against North, and concludes this litigation.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was led by Jack Kaufman, Margaret Spillane and Alison Conn, and was supervised by Thomas P.

Ind. filed Dec. 5, 2019)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgment After Executives Settle Case Alleging an Inflated Truck Pricing Scheme\n\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the resolution of its accounting fraud action against former Celadon Group Inc. executives William Eric Meek and Bobby Peavler. Meek and Peavler agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a final judgment that requires them to each pay a $50,000 civil penalty and bars them from acting as an officer or director of a public company for a period of three years.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleged that Meek, the former president and chief operating officer of Celadon Group, Inc., and Peavler, the former chief financial officer of Celadon Group Inc., participated in a scheme to buy and sell trucks at inflated prices, in some cases double or triple the trucks' fair market value. The complaint alleged these transactions were intended to conceal Celadon's failure to write down the trucks' net book values and take impairment charges. The complaint further alleged that as a result, Celadon overstated its pre-tax income, net income, and earnings per share in its annual report for the period ending June 30, 2016, and in its subsequent filings through the period ending December 31, 2016. Additionally, the complaint alleged Meek and Peavler lied to auditors about the true nature of these transactions.\n\nMeek and Peavler, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, consented to the entry of a final judgment in which they agreed to be permanently enjoined from aiding and abetting future violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder and from committing future violations of Rule 13b2-2. Peavler also agreed to be enjoined from future violations of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. The final judgment requires Meek and Peavler to pay a civil penalty of $50,000 each and bars them from acting as an officer or director of a public company for a period of three years.\n\nMeek and Peavler also agreed to be suspended from appearing and practicing before the SEC as an accountant. The SEC's orders, issued on April 7, 2023, permit Meek and Peavler to apply for reinstatement after three years.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Jaclyn Janssen and Trevor Schumacher and supervised by Amy S.

Beaxy Digital, Ltd., et al., No. 1:23-cv-1962 (N.D. Ill. filed Mar. 29, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Crypto Trading Platform Beaxy and Its Executives for Operating an Unregistered Exchange, Broker, and Clearing Agency\n\nMarket Makers Separately Charged as Unregistered Dealers\n\n\n\n\nOn March 29, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged the crypto asset trading platform beaxy.com (the Beaxy Platform) and its executives for failing to register as a national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The SEC also charged the founder of the platform, Artak Hamazaspyan, and a company he controlled, Beaxy Digital, Ltd., with raising $8 million in an unregistered offering of the Beaxy token (BXY) and alleged that Hamazaspyan misappropriated at least $900,000 for personal use, including gambling. Finally, the SEC charged market makers operating on the Beaxy Platform as unregistered dealers.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, since October 2019, Nicholas Murphy and Randolph Bay Abbott, through the company they managed, Windy Inc., maintained and provided the Beaxy Platform as a web-based trading platform that facilitated buying and selling of crypto assets that were offered and sold as securities. The complaint alleges that Windy, through the Beaxy Platform, violated Sections 5, 15(a), and 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") because it:\n\n\n\tBrought together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers using established, non-discretionary methods under which such orders interacted, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agreed to the terms of a trade, and thus should have registered as an exchange;\n\t\u00a0\n\tActed as an intermediary in making payments and deliveries upon matching sell and buy orders and maintained custody of customer assets, and thus should have registered as a clearing agency; and\n\t\u00a0\n\tWas regularly engaged in the business of effecting transactions for the account of others in crypto assets that were offered and sold as securities, and thus should have registered as a broker.\n\n\nThe SEC's complaint also alleges that, after Murphy and Abbott convinced Hamazaspyan to resign following the unregistered offering of BXY and the misappropriation of investor assets, the two continued the operation of the Beaxy Platform through Windy, and as such are also liable under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as control persons for operating an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency in violation of Sections 5, 15(a), and 17A of the Exchange Act.\n\nAdditionally, the complaint alleges that, in December 2019, Windy entered into an agreement with Brian Peterson and his companies - Braverock Investments LLC, Future Digital Markets Inc., Windy Financial LLC, Future Financial LLC (collectively, the Braverock Entities) - to provide market making services for BXY, and in May 2020, one of these companies entered into a similar market making agreement for another crypto asset security. By doing so, the complaint alleges that Peterson and the Braverock Entities acted as unregistered dealers in violation of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.\n\nPursuant to the Consents filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today, Windy, Murphy, Abbott, and Peterson have agreed to perform certain undertakings, including ceasing all activities as an unregistered exchange, clearing agency, broker, and dealer; shutting down the Beaxy Platform; providing an accounting of assets and funds for the benefit of customers; transferring all customer assets and funds to each respective customer; and destroying any and all BXY in Windy's possession.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Windy, Murphy, Abbott, Peterson, and the Braverock Entities have agreed to permanent injunctions prohibiting them from future violations of the securities laws alleged in the complaint and to pay civil penalties. Specifically, Windy, Abbott, and Murphy agreed to pay a total of $79,200 in civil penalties; Peterson agreed to pay a civil penalty of $6,600; and the Braverock Entities agreed to jointly and severally pay a penalty of $80,000. In addition, Windy agreed to pay $10,779 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and the Braverock Entities agreed to jointly and severally pay $52,000 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest. The penalty amounts reflect the cooperation the staff received from the settling parties during the investigation.\n\nThe SEC is litigating its charges against Hamazaspyan for securities fraud, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and against Hamazaspyan and Beaxy Digital for the unregistered offering of BXY in violation of Section 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Arsen Ablaev, Christine Bautista Jeon, and Craig McShane and supervised by Amy Flaherty Hartman, Jorge G. Tenreiro, and David Hirsch of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. The SEC's litigation will be led by Alyssa Qualls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Morris, enjoining them from violating certain provisions of the federal securities law and imposing other remedies.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, starting in\u00a02013, Ofsink and Morris, along with the other defendants, were involved in a scheme to manipulate the securities of CodeSmart Holdings, Inc. (\"CodeSmart\"). The SEC alleged that Ofsink, an attorney, helped execute the reverse merger of CodeSmart into a public shell company and thereafter, received and sold shares of CodeSmart, the offer and sale of which was not registered, and obscured the holdings of other key individuals. As to Morris, the SEC alleged that he engaged in matched trading for the purpose of inflating the price of CodeSmart securities and received and sold shares of CodeSmart, the offer and sale of which was not registered.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charged Morris with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), Sections 9(a) and the antifraud provisions of 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charged Ofsink with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. On March 31, 2023, the Court entered separate final judgments against Morris and Ofsink by consent in which they each agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions and to penny stock bars. Each agreed to disgorge over ill-gotten gains ($292,409.11 for Ofsink and $27,526 for Morris) and prejudgment interest thereon, the payment of which was deemed satisfied by the restitution order in the parallel criminal proceeding, United States v. DiScala, et al., 14 Cr. 399 (E.D.N.Y.).\n\nThe SEC's litigation is being handled by Todd Brody and Lindsay Moilanen of the New York Regional Office and is being supervised by Sheldon L.

William Andrew Stack, Esq., No. 1:21-cv-00051 (W.D.\u00a0Tex. filed Jan. 15, 2021)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Attorney for Engaging in Fraud and Conducting an Unregistered Securities Offering\n\n\n\n\nOn March 10, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against William Andrew Stack, an attorney and nominal CEO of Preston Corp. (a/k/a Preston Royalty Corp.), a now-defunct financial services provider for the mining industry, enjoining him from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 15, 2021, Preston Corp. purported to be a financial services provider specializing in royalty financing for mining operations, but in reality had no actual operations. The complaint alleges that Stack, a licensed lawyer who had no experience in the mining industry, served as Preston Corp.'s nominal CEO at the behest of the company's undisclosed control person, who had previously been charged by the SEC in another, similar fraud.\n\nThe SEC's complaint further alleges that while serving as the company's figurehead CEO, Stack issued four press releases that materially misled investors, falsely claiming, among other things, that Preston Corp. had entered into a royalty agreement with a third party, and that it had entered into a \"gold mine agreement\" with a third party. Preston Corp. allegedly publicized these press releases while the company and Stack conducted an unregistered distribution of its common stock to retail investors. Stack allegedly misappropriated the proceeds of the offering, diverting the money largely to himself and to the undisclosed control person.\n\nThe final judgment imposed permanent injunctions prohibiting Stack from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(b); imposed a five year officer-and-director bar, a five-year penny stock bar, and, for a period of five years, a bar prohibiting Stack from providing professional legal services relating to Regulation D or other exemptions from the registration provision of the Securities Act. The final judgment further orders Stack to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $438,103.21 and a $333,110 million civil penalty.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was conducted by Alexander M.

Sean Wygovsky and Christopher Matthaei, 2:23-CV-01810 (District of New Jersey, Complaint filed March 30, 2023)\n\n\n\nSEC Charges Hedge Fund Trader and Broker-Dealer Partner in Multi-Million Dollar Spac Insider Trading Scheme\n\n\n\n\nWashington D.C., March 31, 2023 - The Securities and Exchange Commission filed insider trading charges against Sean Wygovsky, a former trader at a Canadian asset management firm, and Christopher Matthaei, a former partner at a U.S. broker-dealer, for using nonpublic information in advance of at least seven merger announcements involving Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) to earn illicit profits of more than $3.4 million.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that Wygovsky learned material non-public information about upcoming SPAC mergers from his employer's involvement in transactions related to the mergers. The complaint further alleges that, from May 2020 through April 2021, Wygovsky used encrypted messaging to tip his close friend and trading client, Matthaei, about the upcoming mergers. According to the complaint, Matthaei, who ran a trading and research group focused on SPACs during the relevant period, allegedly traded on Wygovsky's tips.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, charges Wygovsky and Matthaei with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Matthaei and Wygovsky, and an officer and director bar against Matthaei. Wygovsky has consented to a bifurcated settlement, subject to court approval, under which he will be permanently enjoined from violating the federal securities laws. The SEC previously charged Wygovsky with perpetrating a lucrative front running scheme, and Wygovsky consented to a bifurcated settlement in that matter as well.\n\nIn a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey announced criminal charges against Matthaei.\n\nThe SEC's investigation, which is ongoing, was conducted by Kevin E. Levenberg and Brian R. Higgins of the Philadelphia Regional Office, with assistance by John S. Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit. It was supervised by Brendan P. McGlynn, Scott A.

Mass. filed December 2, 2021)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Judgment Against Individual for Participating in Fraudulent Microcap Scheme\n\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced a judgment against an individual charged with participating in a fraudulent scheme involving unlawful microcap stock sales at the expense of unsuspecting retail investors. Among other things, the final judgment against Amar Bahadoorsingh, last of Canada, ordered him to pay $466,619.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that, from 2016 through at least October 2020, Bahadoorsingh and Canadian resident Vincenzo Carnovale secretly gained control of thinly traded microcap companies, hired stock promoters to create demand for their stock, and generated substantial illicit profits by selling the stock to unsuspecting investors. Bahadoorsingh and Carnovale allegedly hid the fact that they controlled the securities of publicly traded companies. They allegedly misled investors, brokers, and transfer agents (companies that maintain records of stock ownership) in order to convince these parties that the defendants' stock shares were eligible for trading in the public markets, when in fact their stock was not appropriately registered for sale with the SEC. They also allegedly caused the microcap companies to make materially false and misleading statements in their publicly filed financial statements and reports. Additionally, Bahadoorsingh allegedly fabricated documents that he provided to brokers and transfer agents in order to avoid due diligence procedures those parties had in place to comply with the securities laws.\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the federal district court in Boston, Massachusetts entered a final judgment by default against Bahadoorsingh, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act. The Court also imposed a penny stock bar on Bahadoorsingh and ordered him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains of $231,020, $28,416 in prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil penalty of $207,183.\n\nOn June 30, 2022, Bahadoorsingh was ordered in a separate SEC action to pay over $700,000 for his alleged participation in a fraudulent scheme to sell shares of microcap company Aureus Inc.\n\nThe SEC's ongoing case against defendant Vincenzo Carnovale is being handled by David J.

John Barksdale, et al., No. 1:22-cv-01933 (LAK) (S.D.N.Y. filed Mar. 8, 2022)\n\n\nOn March 15, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Defendants John and JonAtina (Tina) Barksdale ordering permanent injunctions, disgorgement with interest, and civil penalties.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleged that from June 2017 to March 2022, the Barksdales raised tens of millions of dollars through two unregistered fraudulent offerings of securities involving a crypto asset called \"Ormeus Coin.\" In addition, the SEC alleged that from June 2017 to April 2018, through a multi-level marketing business called Ormeus Global, the Barksdales offered and sold subscription packages that included Ormeus Coin. As alleged in the complaint, to promote the offerings, John Barksdale held roadshows around the world while he and his sister, Tina, led the production of social media posts, YouTube videos, press releases, and other promotional materials. The complaint also alleged that the defendants falsely claimed that Ormeus Coin was supported by one of the largest crypto asset mining operations in the world, even though they abandoned their mining operations in 2019 after generating less than $3 million in total mining revenue. As further alleged, in many of these investor communications, the defendants falsely stated that Ormeus Coin had a $250 million crypto asset mining operation and was producing $5.4 million to $8 million per month in mining revenues.\n\nThe judgment, entered on the basis of default, enjoins the Barksdales from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. It further enjoins them from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act by engaging in the unregistered offer or sale of securities. The Barksdales were ordered to pay disgorgement of $46,297,463 on a joint and several basis and prejudgment interest of $10,044,822. The Barksdales were also ordered to each pay a civil penalty of $23,148,731.\n\nThe litigation was led by Christopher Carney and Matthew Reisig and supervised by Melissa Armstrong. The SEC's investigation that led to this action was conducted by Mr. Reisig, and supervised by Timothy England and Melissa Hodgman.\n\nAlso see Release 2022-37 (March 8, 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\tJudgment\n\n\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Sapere Wealth Management, LLC and Scott Trease, No. 3:23-cv-00172 (W.D.N.C. filed Mar. 22, 2023)\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against Sapere Wealth Management, LLC, a Matthews, North Carolina-based investment adviser, and its principal, Scott Trease, for unsuitably recommending that three clients invest $7.3 million in risky, alternative-investment deals.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Trease befriended a self-described financier based on shared religious interests in July 2017. The complaint further states that from 2018 through early 2019 this financier helped identify numerous alternative-investment opportunities for Trease and Sapere to consider. The opportunities, which were unlike any others in which Trease or Sapere had ever invested, consistently fell apart and, according to the SEC, raised several red flags indicating that these types of alternative investments were unsuitable for Sapere's and Trease's clients. Nevertheless, the complaint states, in May 2019 Sapere and Trease recommended three clients invest a total of $7.3 million in two such alternative investments that Sapere and Trease incorrectly believed were collateralized by gold. The SEC alleges that Sapere and Trease did not reasonably understand the investments and thus lacked a reasonable basis to recommend them to clients. The complaint further states that in one of the investments, a client ultimately lost $2.3 million, while in the other, $5 million of client money was placed at risk, though the defendants and the self-described financier ultimately secured the funds' return.\n\nThe complaint charges Sapere and Trease with breaching their fiduciary duties of care in violation of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Sapere and Trease have consented to the entry of a final judgment imposing a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 206(2); a five-year injunction requiring Sapere and Trease to engage due-diligence consultants to review certain potential future transactions; a $100,000 civil penalty against Trease; and an undertaking to distribute the SEC's complaint and the final judgment to Sapere's and Trease's clients. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Joshua Hess of the Atlanta Regional Office, and supervised by Matthew F. McNamara and Justin C. Jeffries. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\n\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

James K. Couture, Civil Action No. 1:21-cv-10908 (D. Mass. filed June 1, 2021)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      On March 27, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Massachusetts-based investment adviser, James K. Couture in connection with the SEC's allegations that he engaged in a deceptive scheme to misappropriate a total of approximately $2.9 million from unsuspecting clients.\n \n      The SEC's complaint filed in June 2021 charged that from approximately 2009 to December 2019, Couture, while operating an investment advisory and brokerage business, fraudulently prompted his advisory clients to sell portions of their securities holdings in order to fund large money transfers to an entity that, unbeknownst to his clients, Couture owned and controlled.  According to the complaint, for each transaction, Couture obtained client authorization by falsely claiming that the proceeds would be reinvested for the clients' financial benefit.  In reality, Couture's alleged purpose in arranging these transactions was to divert the sale proceeds for his own benefit.  When clients requested withdrawals, the complaint alleged that Couture took assets from his other advisory clients through a web of third-party accounts to disguise that he was misappropriating money from one client to replace funds he had previously stolen from another.\n \n      Pursuant to the final judgment, to which Couture consented, Couture was permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\n \n      In a parallel action by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, Couture pleaded guilty to ten criminal counts including one count of investment adviser fraud.  On January 11, 2023, Couture was sentenced to 100 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay $1,924,585 in restitution and $2,874,585 in forfeiture.\n \n      The SEC previously issued an order barring Couture from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal adviser, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, as well as participating in the offering of a penny stock.\n \n      The SEC's case is being handled by Rory Alex, Robert Baker, Jennifer Cardello, William Donahue, and Richard Harper, II of the SEC's Boston Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Internal Revenue Service.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Aaron Cain McKnight, et al., No. 3:23-cv-00641 (N.D. Tex. filed Mar. 23, 2023)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      On March 23, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Aaron Cain McKnight with orchestrating three separate fraudulent investment schemes through which he allegedly stole more than $8.4 million from at least 28 investors. The SEC also charged a lawyer, his law firm, a promoter, and McKnight's sister with aiding and abetting aspects of the schemes.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint, between March 2018 and September 2021, McKnight ran three schemes that, while separate, followed a similar pattern. In each scheme, McKnight allegedly portrayed himself as an experienced professional controlling financial services firms, through which he offered investment opportunities that promised extraordinary returns but that, in reality, did not exist. Using his fabricated credentials, he allegedly raised funds from numerous investors only to then use the investors' money for non-investment purposes, including personal expenses, operation of his outside business, and/or Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors.\n \n      The SEC further alleges that lawyer Kenneth Miller and his law firm, Frost & Miller, LLP (\"F&M\"), substantially assisted McKnight's first scheme by receiving and immediately distributing over $2 million of investor funds at McKnight's direction. According to the SEC, Miller and F&M provided this assistance despite not having a clear understanding of why the funds were sent to F&M, who the funds had come from or were going to, or what function the investors expected F&M to serve.\n \n      The SEC's complaint, filed in Texas federal court, charges McKnight and two entities he employed in one of the schemes, BPM Global Investments, LLC (\"BPM Global\") and BPM Asset Management, LLC (\"BPMAM\"), with violating various antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also charges Sherry Rebekka Sims, Harmony Brooke McKnight, Miller, and F&M with aiding and abetting certain of these violations, and names Timothy Neher and his company, Accelerated Venture Partners, LLC, as relief defendants. Additionally, the complaint charges McKnight and Harmony McKnight as control persons under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for the violations of BPM Global and BPMAM. The SEC's complaint seeks permanent injunctions, including conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil penalties, and officer and director bars.\n \n      Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Sims consented to a bifurcated settlement, agreeing to the entry of a final judgment that, among other things, permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from soliciting, or issuing guarantees in connection with, the purchase or sale of securities. Civil penalties will be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the Commission.\n \n      The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jason Anthony and Michael Flanagan, and was supervised by Paul Pashkoff and Melissa Hodgman. The SEC's litigation will be led by Anna Area and supervised by David Nasse.\n \n      The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued investor alerts on the red flags of investment fraud.

Martin Silver, Civil Action No. 1:21-cv-3179 (S.D.N.Y. filed Apr. 13, 2021).\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n   \n \n      On March 23, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final consent judgment against Martin Silver, the co-founder of International Investment Group (IIG), a formerly registered investment adviser, enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint, from October\u00a02013 to at least July 2018, Silver, defrauded IIG's investment advisory clients by, among other things, grossly overvaluing the assets in IIG's flagship hedge fund. As alleged, the overvaluation of these assets resulted in the fund paying inflated fees to IIG, some of which went to Silver.\u00a0 The complaint further alleges that Silver falsely reported to investors that certain fake and overvalued loan assets, which IIG sold between funds it advised, were legitimate assets and fairly valued.\n \n      The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Silver with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Silver, who cooperated with the SEC, consented to a bifurcated settlement, agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions, with monetary relief to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the Commission.\n \n      The final judgment orders disgorgement of $2,306,856, representing Silver's ill-gotten gains, and prejudgment interest of $243,403.98, and that disgorgement shall be deemed satisfied by the restitution order entered against him in the parallel criminal proceeding, United States v. Hu, et al., 20 Cr. 360 (S.D.N.Y.) (AKH).  In that proceeding, Silver pleaded guilty and has been sentenced and ordered to pay restitution and forfeit assets.\n \n      The SEC previously charged IIG with fraud on November 21, 2019, and revoked IIG's registration as an investment adviser on November\u00a026, 2019.\u00a0 On March 30, 2020, the SEC obtained a final judgment on consent enjoining IIG from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and requiring IIG to pay more than $35 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.\n \n      The SEC's investigation was conducted by Lindsay Moilanen and Diego Brucculeri of the New York Regional Office, with assistance from Eli Bass of the Division of Examinations. The litigation was handled by Ms. Moilanen.\u00a0 The matter was supervised by Sheldon L. Pollock and Osman Nawaz.

Philip R. Jacoby, Jr., et al., Civil Action No. 17-cv-03230-SAG (D. Md. filed Nov. 2, 2017)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      On March 17, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland entered a final consent judgment against Philip R. Jacoby, a former Chief Financial Officer of biotech company Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., for his role in Osiris's fraudulent conduct.\n \n      The SEC's complaint, filed November 2, 2017, charged Osiris with routinely overstating company performance and issuing fraudulent financial statements for a period of nearly two years. The SEC alleged that Jacoby caused Osiris to book fictitious and premature revenue and provided false information to Osiris's auditors. On February 2, 2021, the District Court found that Jacoby violated provisions of the federal securities laws prohibiting: fraud in connection with the offer, purchase, or sale of securities; false certifications of SEC filings; aiding and abetting false SEC filings; and lying to auditors.\n \n      Jacoby consented to a final judgment enjoining him from future violations of: Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, and 13b2-2 promulgated thereunder; as well as aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. The judgment further prohibits Jacoby from acting as an officer or director of a public company, and finds Jacoby liable for reimbursement of $223,965.88 in Osiris stock sale profits pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, but waives payment of all but $45,000 of this amount, and does not impose a civil penalty, based on his sworn statement of financial condition.\n \n      Osiris previously settled the SEC's charges and paid a $1.5 million civil penalty. One of Osiris's former Chief Financial Officers, Gregory I. Law, was dismissed from the case in September 2019. In October 2019, Bobby Dwayne Montgomery, Osiris's former Chief Business Officer, consented to a judgment enjoining him from future violations of the provisions of the federal securities laws that prohibit falsifying books and records and lying to auditors, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $40,000. Osiris's former Chief Executive Officer, Lode Debrabandere, was dismissed from the case in November 2022. The final judgment entered against Jacoby concludes this litigation.\n \n      The SEC's investigation was conducted by Laura Ordaz, Anne Romero, and Danielle Voorhees, and was supervised by Laura Metcalfe and Jason Burt. The SEC's litigation was led by Nicholas Heinke, Zachary Carlyle, and Polly Atkinson, and was supervised by Greg Kasper and Mr. Burt.\n\n      \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      Judgment\n      \n\n  \n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Watson, Jr., the company's CEO.\n \n      The SEC's complaint, filed on February 23, 2023, alleged that from approximately January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2021, Watson, Rao, and Han raised about $50 million from investors through repeated misrepresentations concerning Ozy Media's basic financial condition, business relationships, and fundraising efforts.  The defendants allegedly routinely and purposely presented prospective investors with false financial information that grossly inflated Ozy Media's annual revenue by at least 100 percent.  The SEC's complaint further alleged that Watson and Rao orchestrated a scheme in which Rao impersonated an executive from YouTube in an effort to support Ozy Media's false claims to a prospective investor that the company was receiving licensing revenue from YouTube when it was not.  According to the SEC's complaint, when the prospective investor discovered the ruse, Watson falsely attributed Rao's impersonation to Rao suffering from a \"mental health crisis.\"\n \n      Rao and Han have consented to the entry of judgments enjoining each from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment entered against Rao additionally bars him from serving as an officer and director of a public company for ten years. Civil monetary penalties against Rao and Han are to be determined at a later date by the Court.\n \n      The SEC's ongoing litigation against Ozy Media and Watson is being led by Karolina Klyuchnikova and Christine D.

Brian Robert Sodi, et al., No. 5-18-cv-00313-MHH (N.D. Ala. filed Feb. 26, 2018)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      On January 31, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama issued an amended final judgment against Florida resident Brian Robert Sodi and two of his now-defunct companies, Capital Financial Media LLC (CFM) and List Data Solutions LLC (LDS), for securities fraud and other violations in connection with promoting penny stocks in scalping and pump-and-dump schemes in 2013.\n \n      The Commission's complaint, filed February 26, 2018, alleged that Sodi, a CPA, secretly acquired shares of two companies and then sold those shares while using CFM and LDS to disseminate statements urging investors to buy those stocks, and without disclosing his holdings, sales, or plans to sell. Sodi, CFM, and LDS agreed to settle the charges in September 2019, agreeing to injunctive relief and to pay, jointly and severally, a total of $1,268,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, with this obligation to be offset by the total amount of restitution and/or forfeiture ultimately ordered in the parallel criminal proceeding against Sodi. The court entered final judgment on April 16, 2020, requiring any funds paid by the defendants to be remitted to the United States Treasury.\n \n      In a parallel criminal action filed in the Northern District of Alabama, Sodi pleaded guilty on May 19, 2019 to one count of securities fraud. Sodi was later ordered to pay $338,056 in forfeiture.\n \n      On January 31, 2023, the court issued an amended final judgment that orders disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $929,995 to be paid to the Commission, so that it may be distributed to harmed investors.\n \n      Sodi has also been suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission under Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.\n \n      The SEC's litigation was conducted by Patrick Costello, with assistance from Sarah Lamoree and J.

Evoqua Water Technologies Corp. and Imran Parekh, No. 1:23-cv-00105 (D.R.I. filed Mar. 13, 2023)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Evoqua Water Technologies Corp. and its former division-level finance director Imran Parekh for improper accounting practices that materially misstated Evoqua's revenue reported in the company's SEC filings during 2017 and 2018. Evoqua and Parekh have agreed to settle the charges by, among other things, agreeing to injunctions against future violations of the securities laws and Evoqua paying a civil penalty of $8.5 million. Monetary and other relief against Parekh will be left to later decision by the court.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Rhode Island, from at least the fourth quarter of 2016 through August 2018, Parekh, as the Finance Director of one of Evoqua's divisions based in Rhode Island, engaged in fraudulent accounting practices that resulted in Evoqua improperly reporting materially false revenue amounts in its financial statements filed with the Commission. The SEC's complaint alleged that Parekh inflated the revenue Evoqua reported quarterly and at year-end by counting revenue from sales much earlier than accounting principles permitted. The complaint alleged that Parekh improperly accounted for so-called \"bill-and-hold\" transactions (where a company bills a purchaser for a product but the seller does not deliver the product to the purchaser until some future date), for which Evoqua recognized revenue from the sale of filtration products earlier than permitted and without meeting the criteria found in accounting principles to be able to immediately recognize the revenue.\n \n      The complaint further alleges that negligent conduct at Evoqua's corporate level in managing the financial reporting and accounting controls processes facilitated Parekh's improper accounting practices. As a result of the fraudulent scheme, the complaint alleges, Evoqua improperly reported nearly $12 million of additional expected revenue for its fiscal year 2017 in its registration statement and its initial public offering (IPO) Prospectus filed with the Commission in October and November 2017; that the misconduct continued through Evoqua's first year as a public company, resulting in inaccurate books and records and material misstatements of Evoqua's financial condition in subsequent filings with the Commission; and that by failing to disclose to investors (or in filings with the Commission) that Evoqua reported uncompleted sales as revenue by misapplying bill-and-hold accounting criteria, Evoqua misled investors and potential investors about the true financial picture of the company.\n \n      Evoqua has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"); the periodic reporting provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 12b-20, 13a-l, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; and the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act. The final judgment would also order Evoqua to comply with certain undertakings, including an agreement to implement recommended improvements to its system of internal accounting controls, and to pay a civil penalty of $8.5 million.\n \n      Parekh has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10(b)(5) thereunder; from aiding and abetting the periodic reporting provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-l, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder; from aiding and abetting the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act; and from knowingly circumventing an issuer's system of accounting controls or knowingly falsifying an issuer's books and records in violation of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act. The judgment also orders that Parekh will be ordered to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty, the amounts of which will be determined by the court, and that the court will determine whether Parekh should be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and if so the duration of such a bar. The settlements with Evoqua and Parekh are subject to court approval.\n \n      The case was handled by Kerry Vasta, Jonathan Allen, Peter Moores, David London, and Amy Gwiazda of the Boston Regional Office.\n\n      \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      SEC Complaint\n      \n\n  \n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Mass. filed Aug. 19, 2021)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      On March 9, 2023, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Joshua Dax Cabrera ordering him to pay approximately $1,126,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties in a securities offering fraud previously filed by the SEC in August 2021.\n \n      The SEC's complaint alleged that Cabrera partnered with co-defendant Paul Hess to fraudulently raise more than $12.9 million from more than 150 U.S. and foreign investors by offering unregistered securities in Medsis International, Inc. from 2015 through 2020.  The complaint alleged that while offering Medsis securities, Cabrera and Hess made multiple material misrepresentations and misleading statements about Medsis to investors concerning the existence and value of contracts with customers, existing and expected revenue, and business operations.  The complaint also alleged that Cabrera and Hess misrepresented to investors their personal use of investor funds.\n \n      Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Cabrera consented to a final judgment in the SEC action that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the securities offering registration requirements of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The judgment also prohibits Cabrera from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security with the exception of Cabrera purchasing or selling securities for his own personal accounts, and finds him liable for disgorgement of $536,895, prejudgment interest of $52,816, and a civil penalty of $536,895.\n \n      The District Court previously entered final judgment against Cabrera's co-defendant, Paul Hess, on December 19, 2022, as part of a settlement in which Hess agreed to pay approximately $840,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties and be enjoined from future violations of the securities laws and from offering and selling securities to others.\n \n      The SEC's case, which remains ongoing against Medsis, is being handled by Peter Bryan Moores, Marc Jones, and Kevin Currid of the Boston Regional Office.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

The SEC alleges that Abdelkader determined, based on facts he learned from his wife, that there was a high likelihood of Audentes being acquired.  Using this material nonpublic information he misappropriated from his wife, Abdelkader allegedly purchased short-term, out-of-the money Audentes call options on October 17 and October 18, 2019.  The SEC further alleges that when Audentes' stock price rose by approximately 106% following the acquisition announcement, Abdelkader obtained ill-gotten gains of approximately $81,580.\n \n      Abdelkader consented to the entry of a final judgment that would resolve all claims and permanently enjoin him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Abdelkader agreed to pay a civil money penalty of $81,580 and to disgorge his profits with prejudgment interest totaling $90,570.  The settlement is subject to court approval.\n \n      The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jason Schall, Lauren Poper and Wendy Kong.

Moynes, et al.;, ivil Action No. 22-cv-11006 (D. Mass. filed June 27, 2022)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      On March 8, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgments against Canadian citizen Bradley Moynes and Canadian corporation Digatrade Financial Corp., in connection with the SEC's allegations that they engaged in a deceptive scheme involving microcap companies that generated more than $1.5 million in unlawful stock sale proceeds at the expense of unsuspecting retail investors. Among other things, the defendants have been ordered to pay a total of over $3.4 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.\n \n      On June 27, 2022, the SEC charged that Moynes was the President, CEO and Director of two small and thinly traded companies, Formcap Corporation and Digatrade, whose stock was publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets.  According to the complaint, Moynes used foreign nominee companies to hold stock in these microcap companies, thus concealing his ownership.  The SEC alleged that Moynes and his associates generated demand for the stock they controlled by paying promoters to tout the stock and then secretly sold stock into that demand, generating substantial illicit profits from unsuspecting investors.  The complaint alleged that, as a result of Moynes' deceptive conduct, investors buying the stock he sold were deprived of important information-that the stock they purchased was being dumped by the President and majority shareholder of the company.\n \n      Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC's complaint, Moynes and Digatrade consented to the entry of final judgments enjoining them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and also enjoined Moynes from directly or indirectly, including but not limited to, through any entity owned or controlled by him, participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security.  The final judgments also imposed penny stock bars against Moynes and Digatrade and imposed an officer and director bar against Moynes.  With respect to financial remedies, Moynes was ordered to pay disgorgement of $1,042,407, prejudgment interest of $253,868, and a civil penalty of $207,183.  Digatrade was ordered to pay disgorgement of $510,000 and prejudgment interest of $133,309 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  $62,007 of Digatrade's disgorgement is joint and several with Moynes.  The SEC's complaint also named Vancap Ventures, Inc., a company owned by Moynes and that received trading proceeds from Moynes' fraudulent schemes, as a relief defendant.   Vancap was ordered to pay disgorgement of $980,400 and prejudgment interest of $235,577 on a joint and several basis with Moynes.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

The complaint alleges that, among other things, from at least May 2018 through July 2021, Defendants overcharged clients for advisory fees by fraudulently inflating the fee amounts in clients' advisory agreements, without the clients' knowledge or consent, so that they could collect higher fees than their clients had agreed to pay.  The complaint also alleges that, from at least May 2018 through at least October 2022, Defendants misappropriated clients' funds by fraudulently applying charges to their clients' credit card and bank accounts for, among other things, purported investments or additional advisory fees to which the Defendants were not entitled.  The Defendants allegedly used the clients' funds obtained from these fraudulent activities for their personal benefit and to repay certain clients who complained about unusual account activity.  The complaint also alleges that the Defendants falsified documents and made Ponzi-like payments to clients to conceal their fraudulent activities.\n \n      The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charges Adam and Daniel with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and seeks injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.\n \n      The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, was conducted by Marlene Key-Patterson and Nick Magina, and supervised by Steven Klawans in the Chicago Regional Office.

Riley, of Leesburg, Virginia, solicited advisory clients and other individuals to invest in securities issued by his companies, Green Light Energy, LLC and Mustang Resources, Inc.  According to the complaint, Riley induced investors to invest by claiming that he would use their funds to acquire, develop, and operate oil & gas drilling projects in Texas.  The SEC alleges that, in reality, Riley misappropriated the funds, using some for personal expenses and losing the majority through risky day trading.\n \n      The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on March 1, 2023, charges Riley with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Riley has consented to the entry of a judgment which, if approved by the court, would permanently enjoin him from violating the charged provisions and bar him from acting as an officer or director of a public company, with disgorgement and civil penalties to be decided later by the court.\n \n      The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia also announced criminal charges against Riley.\n \n      The SEC's investigation was conducted by Christine R.

Nishad Singh, No. 1:23-cv-01691 (S.D.N.Y. filed Feb. 28, 2023)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Nishad Singh, the former Co-Lead Engineer of FTX Trading Ltd. (FTX), for his role in a multiyear scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX, the crypto trading platform started by Singh along with Samuel Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang. Investigations into other securities law violations and into other entities and persons relating to the alleged misconduct are ongoing.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint, Singh created software code that allowed FTX customer funds to be diverted to Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund owned by Bankman-Fried and Wang, despite false assurances by Bankman-Fried to investors that FTX was a safe crypto asset trading platform with sophisticated risk mitigation measures to protect customer assets and that Alameda was just another customer with no special privileges. The complaint alleges that Singh knew or should have known that such statements were false and misleading.\n \n      The complaint also alleges that Singh was an active participant in the scheme to deceive FTX's investors. The complaint further alleges that, even as it became clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole for the funds already unlawfully diverted, Bankman-Fried, with the knowledge of Singh, directed hundreds of millions of dollars more in FTX customer funds to Alameda, which were used for additional venture investments and loans to Bankman-Fried, Singh, and other FTX executives. Moreover, according to the complaint, as FTX neared collapse, Singh withdrew approximately $6 million from FTX for personal use and expenditures, including the purchase of a multi-million dollar house and donations to charitable causes.\n \n      The SEC's complaint charges Singh with violating Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. The SEC's complaint seeks an injunction against future securities law violations; a conduct-based injunction that prohibits Singh from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, except for his own personal accounts; disgorgement of his ill-gotten gains; a civil penalty; and an officer and director bar. Singh has consented to a bifurcated settlement, which is subject to court approval, under which he will be permanently enjoined from violating the federal securities laws, the above-described conduct-based injunction, and an officer and director bar. Upon motion of the SEC, the court will determine whether and what amount of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and/or a civil penalty is appropriate, as well as the length of the officer and director bar and the conduct-based injunction imposed against Singh.\n \n      In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced charges against Singh.\n \n      Singh is cooperating with the SEC's ongoing investigation, which is being conducted by Devlin N. Su, Ivan Snyder, and David S. Brown of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and Brian Huchro, Pasha Salimi, and Ainsley Kerr. It is being supervised by Amy Flaherty Hartman, Michael Brennan, Jorge Tenreiro, and David Hirsch.

Michael K. Molen, Enviro Impact Resources, Inc., f/k/a Industry Source Consulting, Inc., Seth M. Molen, and Pixel Arcanum, Inc., No. 1:23-cv-00735-LMM (N.D. Ga., filed Feb. 16, 2023)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges alleging securities fraud and registration violations in a complaint filed against Enviro Impact Resources, Inc., formerly known as Industry Source Consulting, Inc. (OTC Pink: INSO) (\"INSO\"), a Georgia microcap company.  The SEC's complaint further charges alleged fraud and registration violations by INSO's former CEO Michael Molen, his son Seth Molen, and Pixel Arcanum, Inc. (\"Pixel\"), a Georgia company that was controlled by both Michael and Seth Molen.\n \n      The complaint alleges that the defendants made numerous false and misleading statements and engaged in other deceptive conduct during the relevant period, largely for Michael Molen's financial benefit. According to the SEC's complaint, from at least 2014 to 2022, under Michael Molen's direction, INSO publicly posted false and misleading annual and quarterly disclosure reports, including false financial statements, and false and misleading attorney opinion letters relating to INSO's disclosure reports. The complaint also states that the defendants made false and misleading statements to third parties, including brokerage firms and INSO's transfer agent, and engaged in other deceptive conduct, including the creation and use of forged documents, to facilitate Pixel's fraudulent and unregistered transactions in INSO stock and convertible promissory notes.\n \n      The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, charges Michael Molen, INSO, Seth Molen, and Pixel with violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule\u00a010b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, all four defendants have consented to permanent injunctions from violations of those provisions, and also to payments of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court. Michael Molen and Seth Molen have also consented to the entry of officer and director bars and penny stock bars, and Pixel has consented to the entry of a penny stock bar. The settlements are subject to the approval of the district court.\n \n      The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Lucy Graetz in the Atlanta Regional Office, and supervised by Natalie Brunson and Justin Jeffries, in coordination with the Enforcement Division's Microcap Fraud Task Force. William Hicks and Graham Loomis are leading the SEC's ongoing litigation.\n\n      \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      SEC Complaint\n      \n\n  \n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Energy & Environmental Investments, LLC; Energy & Environment, Inc.; Amir A. Sardari; and Narysa Sardari Luddy, No. 23-civ-00338 (C.D. Cal. filed February 24, 2023)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      The SEC today filed and sought court approval for a full settlement of an offering fraud case charging California-based entities Energy & Environmental Investments, LLC (\"EEI\") and Energy & Environment, Inc. (\"E&E) with conducting a fraudulent securities offering that raised $9.3 million from over 200 investors nationwide since August 31, 2012.  The complaint also charged EEI's CEO Amir Sardari and his daughter, EEI's former Vice President of Investor Relations Narysa Luddy, for their roles in the offering.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, EEI operated a call center based in Orange County, California, where sales agents employed high-pressure sales tactics to solicit investors to purchase EEI shares.  As alleged, defendants claimed they would use investor money to acquire and develop clean energy projects; however, defendants allegedly instead spent approximately $4.42 million, or 47% of investor funds, on the call center's payroll, marketing, and other expenses, including transferring over $1 million to Luddy, who spent the money on personal expenses.  The complaint further alleges that defendants used investor funds to pay investor returns in a Ponzi-like scheme.\n \n      The SEC action was coordinated with the resolution yesterday of the District Attorney's parallel criminal case against Sardari and Luddy, The People of the State of California v. Sardari, OCDA 01012011, which was previously filed in California Superior Court in Orange County on August 19, 2021.  In the criminal case, Defendants Sardari and Luddy each pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of Section 25110 of the Corporation Code and set aside payments of more than $500,000 toward disgorgement and restitution.\n \n      In the SEC case, Sardari, Luddy, EEI, and E&E consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, which would permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, prohibit the individual defendants from participating in any unregistered security offerings (with the exception of trading in securities on a national market for their own accounts), and impose officer and director bars.  The final judgment, if approved by the court, would also hold EEI liable for payment of $3,414,836 in disgorgement plus $977,949 in prejudgment interest, as well as a $1,035,909 civil penalty.  In addition, the final judgment, if approved by the court, would order (1) Luddy to pay $1,009,192 in disgorgement plus $289,015 in prejudgment interest, and (2) E&E to pay a $200,000 civil penalty.\n \n      The SEC's Retail Strategy Task Force and Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the SEC's SALI database to find information about certain people who have had judgments or orders issued against them in SEC court actions or administrative proceedings.\n \n      The SEC's investigation was conducted by Brittany Garmyn, Cooper Rekrut, and Shipra Wells, and supervised by C. Joshua Felker and Melissa Hodgman.

The SEC filed its action on September 21, 2021, charging Back to Green Mining and its two managing members, Jim\u0083\u00a9nez and Manuel Portalatin, with participating in a fraudulent and unregistered offering in a purported \"green\" mining venture. On September 23, 2021, the district court entered a consent judgment against Portalatin.\n\n\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleged that from August 2016 until at least 2020, Back to Green, Jim\u0083\u00a9nez, and Portalatin offered and sold to retail investors in Puerto Rico and at least five U.S. states the opportunity to share in the profits of a purported Colombian gold mining operation. According to the complaint, the offering, which was not registered with the Commission, was part of a fraudulent scheme that raised approximately $2.7 million. Jim\u0083\u00a9nez and Back to Green allegedly placed advertisements promising investors exorbitant returns, and each of the defendants presented investors with materials that falsely stated that all permits necessary to mine in Colombia had been obtained. \n\n\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Back to Green and Jim\u0083\u00a9nez consented to entry of a final judgment: permanently enjoining each of them from future violations of Sections 17(a), 5(a), and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; permanently enjoining Jim\u0083\u00a9nez from participating in securities offerings not registered with the SEC; ordering Back to Green and Jim\u0083\u00a9nez to pay, on a joint and several basis, $1,995,538 in disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest of $410,728; and ordering Back to Green and Jim\u0083\u00a9nez to pay civil penalties of $1,035,909 and $207,183, respectively.\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Frederick L. Sharp et al., No. 1:21-cv-11276 (D.\u00a0Mass. filed Aug. 5, 2021)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      On February 16, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgments by consent against Canadian resident Graham R. Taylor and Maryland resident William T. Kaitz.  In August 2021, the SEC charged Taylor and Kaitz and seven other defendants for their roles in fraudulent schemes that collectively generated hundreds of millions of dollars from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors in the United States and around the world.  Among other relief, the judgment orders Taylor to pay more than $4.9 million and Kaitz to pay more than $1.3 million.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint, Canadian resident Frederick Sharp masterminded a complex scheme from 2011 to 2019 in which he and his associates enabled control persons of microcap companies, whose stock was publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets, to conceal their control and ownership of huge amounts of the stock and then surreptitiously dump the stock into the U.S. markets, in violation of federal securities laws.\u00a0 The services Sharp and his associates allegedly provided included furnishing networks of offshore shell companies to conceal stock ownership, arranging stock transfers and money transmittals, and providing encrypted accounting and communications systems.\n \n      The complaint alleges that one group of control persons comprised of three defendants frequently collaborated with Sharp to sell massive stock positions while hiding their control positions and stock promotional activities from the investing public.  Taylor allegedly coordinated with these defendants to sell shares fraudulently and he received a significant cut of the illegal stock sale proceeds.  According to the complaint, Kaitz worked as a promoter and touted stocks that the control group simultaneously planned to sell, while concealing their roles.\n \n      Taylor, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, has consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act.  Taylor's judgment orders him to pay disgorgement of $3,432,412, prejudgment interest of $1,285,272, and a civil penalty of $207,183.  Kaitz, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, has consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Kaitz's judgment orders him to pay disgorgement of $812,854, prejudgment interest of $279,014, and a civil penalty of $215,000.  Both judgments further impose penny stock bars against Taylor and Kaitz.  The court previously entered a judgment by default against Sharp that, among other relief, ordered him to pay more than $50 million.\n \n      The ongoing litigation against the remaining defendants is being handled by Kathleen Shields, David London, Alfred Day, and Ryan Murphy of the Boston Regional Office and Katherine Bromberg of the Enforcement Division's Retail Strategy Task Force.\n\n      \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      Judgment - William T.

Candlestick Capital Management LP et al., No. 3:23-cv-00206 (D. Conn. filed Feb. 17, 2023)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      The Securities and Exchange Commission on February 17, 2023 filed a settled complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against investment advisory firm Candlestick Capital Management LP for violating an SEC Rule when it purchased stock in a public offering for two private fund clients after selling short the same stock for those clients, during a time period when the SEC Rule prohibited those purchases. The complaint also names the two private fund clients, Candlestick Master Fund LP and Candlestick US F&F Fund LP, as relief defendants.  Candlestick Capital has agreed to pay an $810,000 penalty to settle the charges.  The two private fund clients have agreed to disgorge the profits received from Candlestick Capital's unlawful trading, totaling approximately $1.6 million, plus prejudgment interest.  The settlement is subject to court approval.\n \n      The SEC's complaint alleges that in June 2020 Candlestick Capital violated Rule 105, which prohibits short selling an equity security during a restricted period (generally five business days before a covered public offering) and then purchasing the same security in the offering, absent an exception.  The Rule applies regardless of the trader's intent, and is designed to prevent potentially manipulative short selling before the pricing of covered offerings.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint, after concluding it had violated Rule 105, Candlestick Capital did not initiate a formal review of its trading history or self-report its violation to the Commission.  The complaint alleges that Candlestick Capital only acknowledged the violation after Commission staff asked about it during a routine examination in 2021.  According to the complaint, Candlestick Capital has since undertaken remedial steps, including revising its Rule 105 policies and procedures.\n \n      The SEC's complaint charges Candlestick Capital with violating Rule 105 of Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Candlestick Capital consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering it to pay a penalty of $810,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Candlestick Master Fund has agreed to the entry of a final judgment ordering it to disgorge profits of $1,565,305 and to pay interest of $89,439, and Candlestick US F&F Fund has agreed to the entry of a final judgement ordering it to pay disgorgement of $55,092 and to pay interest of $3,147.  Candlestick Capital has also agreed to the entry of a related order in SEC administrative proceedings finding that it violated Rule 105, based on the same facts as alleged in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings in the order, Candlestick Capital agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Rule 105.\n \n      The SEC's investigation was conducted by Anne Hancock, Dawn Edick, Chip Harper, and Amy Gwiazda of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from Wendy Kong of the Office of Investigative and Market Analytics.\n\n      \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      SEC Complaint\n      \n\n  \n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC et al., No. 1:23-cv-10351 (D. Mass. filed Feb. 17, 2023)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      The Securities and Exchange Commission on February 17, 2023 filed a settled complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against investment advisory firm HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC for violating an SEC Rule by purchasing stock in a public offering for five private fund clients after selling short the same stock, during a period when the SEC Rule prohibited those purchases.  The complaint also names the three private funds that ultimately received the profits from HITE Hedge Asset Management's unlawful trading, HITE Hedge LP, HITE Hedge II LP, and HITE Hedge Offshore Ltd., as relief defendants.  HITE Hedge Asset Management has agreed to pay a $103,591 penalty to settle the charges.  The three funds have agreed to disgorge the profits received from HITE Hedge Asset Management's unlawful trading, totaling approximately $111,000, plus prejudgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n \n      The SEC's complaint alleges that in May 2021 HITE Hedge Asset Management violated Rule 105, which prohibits short selling an equity security during a restricted period (generally five business days before a covered public offering) and then purchasing the same security in the covered offering, absent an exception.  The Rule applies regardless of the trader's intent, and is designed to prevent potentially manipulative short selling before the pricing of covered offerings.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint, at the time of its unlawful trading, HITE Hedge Asset Management did not have any formal written policies relating to Rule 105.  The SEC's complaint alleges that it was not until after the SEC began its investigation into the illegal trading that HITE Hedge Asset Management implemented a written Rule 105 policy, conducted a review of its trading history to determine if other Rule 105 violations had occurred, and otherwise enhanced its compliance measures.\n \n      The SEC's complaint charges HITE Hedge Asset Management with violating Rule 105 of Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, HITE Hedge Asset Management consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering it to pay a penalty of $103,591.

HITE Hedge Asset Management has also agreed to the entry of a related order in SEC administrative proceedings finding that it violated Rule 105, based on the same facts as alleged in the complaint.

Reliable One Resources, Inc., Quantum Filtration, Inc., Clyde Cameron Cravey, and Kenneth Wiedrich, No. 6:23-CV-00006-JCB (E.D. Tex. filed Jan. 6, 2023)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on January 6, 2023, it filed an emergency action in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Clyde Cameron Cravey and Kenneth Wiedrich, through two entities they controlled, Reliable One Resources, Inc. and Quantum Filtration, Inc., were actively engaged in a fraudulent, unregistered offering that had raised approximately $34 million from over 500 investors.  On January 9, 2023, the Court issued orders temporarily restraining the defendants' ongoing offering, temporarily freezing the defendants' assets, appointing a temporary receiver, and granting other emergency relief.\n \n      The SEC's complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants sought to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic by promoting false claims that Quantum Filtration was using a cutting-edge technology to produce and sell an N-95 certified facemask.  In reality, the mask had no N-95 certification.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that Reliable One imminently expected the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve the facemask for sale, even though the defendants never submitted the necessary application to the FDA.  The complaint also alleges that the defendants touted business deals that did not exist, misled investors about Reliable One's use of investor funds, and failed to disclose Cravey's involvement in the companies to prevent investors from discovering negative information about his past, including that, in 2012, a Texas court entered an $8 million judgment against him for his role in a fraudulent securities offering.\n \n      The SEC's complaint charges Cravey, Wiedrich, Reliable One Resources, and Quantum Filtration with violating the antifraud and securities-registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks injunctions, civil penalties, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains (with prejudgment interest) against each defendant, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars against Wiedrich and Cravey.\n \n      Following the filing of the complaint and the entry of the Court's January 9, 2023 orders, Wiedrich and Cravey agreed to partially settle the SEC's claims against them without admitting or denying the allegations.  On February 8, 2023, the Court entered a judgment reflecting those settlements.  The judgment permanently enjoins Wiedrich and Cravey from further violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and imposes an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and a conduct-based injunction against each of them.  The judgment provides that the Court will resolve the SEC's claims for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties upon later motion by the SEC.  Separately on February 8, 2023, the Court entered an unopposed order freezing the defendants' assets and appointing a receiver that will remain in place until further order of the Court.  The Court also entered an unopposed preliminary injunction against Reliable One Resources and Quantum Filtration.\n \n      The SEC's investigation was conducted by Catherine Floyd and Jody Z. Moore of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office, under the supervision of Timothy S. McCole and Eric R. Werner.  The litigation is being led by David Reece and supervised by B.

Payward Ventures, Inc. (D/B/A Kraken) and Payward Trading, Ltd. (D/B/A Kraken), No. 3:23-cv-00588 (N.D. Cal. filed Feb. 9, 2923)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Payward Ventures, Inc. and Payward Trading Ltd., both commonly known as Kraken, with failing to register the offer and sale of their crypto asset staking-as-a-service program, whereby investors transfer crypto assets to Kraken for staking in exchange for advertised annual investment returns of as much as 21 percent.\n \n      To settle the SEC's charges, the two Kraken entities agreed to immediately cease offering or selling securities through crypto asset staking services or staking programs and pay $30 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint, since 2019, Kraken has offered and sold its crypto asset \"staking services\" to the general public, whereby Kraken pools certain crypto assets transferred by investors and stakes them on behalf of those investors. Staking is a process in which investors lock up - or \"stake\" - their crypto tokens with a blockchain validator with the goal of being rewarded with new tokens when their staked crypto tokens become part of the process for validating data for the blockchain. When investors provide tokens to staking-as-a-service providers, they lose control of those tokens and take on risks associated with those platforms, with very little protection. The complaint alleges that Kraken touts that its staking investment program offers an easy-to-use platform and benefits that derive from Kraken's efforts on behalf of investors, including Kraken's strategies to obtain regular investment returns and payouts.\n \n      In addition to ceasing the staking program and the monetary relief, Payward Ventures, Inc. and Payward Trading, Ltd, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment, subject to court approval, that would permanently enjoin each of them from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and permanently enjoin them and any entity they control from, directly or indirectly, offering or selling securities through crypto asset staking services or staking programs.\n \n      The SEC's investigation was conducted by Laura D'Allaird and Elizabeth Goody, under the supervision of Paul Kim, Jorge G.

(\"CodeSmart\").  The SEC alleged that Shapiro, as CEO of CodeSmart, engaged in a promotional campaign to artificially inflate the price of the stock.  Meanwhile Josephberg and another individual invested their brokerage clients in CodeSmart.  In short, the SEC alleged that the plan was for the defendants to profit at the expense of Josephberg's brokerage clients.\n \n      The SEC's complaint charged Josephberg with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and charged Shapiro with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  On February 8, 2023, the Court entered separate final judgments against Josephberg and Shapiro by consent in which they each agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions and to penny stock bars.  Shapiro additionally consented to an officer and director bar.  Josephberg agreed to disgorge over $735,000 in ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest thereon, the payment of which was deemed satisfied by the restitution order in the parallel criminal proceeding, United States v. DiScala, et al., 14 Cr. 399 (E.D.N.Y.).\n \n      The SEC's litigation is being handled by Todd Brody and Lindsay Moilanen of the New York Regional Office and is being supervised by Sheldon L. Pollock and Joseph Sansone.

GexCrypto Corp. (a/k/a GexCrypto Global Trading Corp.) and Emiliano S. Ryn, No. 2:23-cv-00191 (D. Nev. filed Feb. 6, 2023)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Las Vegas, Nevada resident Emiliano S. Ryn and his company GexCrypto Corp. with defrauding members of the Filipino community in a scheme involving crypto assets.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, Ryn presented himself as a successful Filipino entrepreneur in the cryptocurrency space who could help the members of his community also become rich through investing in GexCrypto, a purported first-of-its-kind crypto asset trading platform, and in a second crypto asset mining business. From late 2017 through mid-2018, Ryn allegedly raised over $800,000 from 26 investors, some of whom took out home equity loans in order to invest. According to the complaint, despite Ryn portraying GexCrypto as a world-class trading platform with superior service and technology, the platform was never built and was never operational. The complaint further alleges that Ryn's promises to investors of guaranteed returns from the crypto asset mining business, a minimum of $10,000 per month, were also false. In reality, Ryn never paid any returns, and investors lost all of their contributions.\n \n      The SEC's complaint charges Ryn and GexCrypto with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Ryn and GexCrypto each consented to final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions and ordering them to pay, on a joint-and-several basis, disgorgement of $825,994.37, prejudgment interest of $187,567.87, and a civil money penalty of $1,000,000.  The final judgment against Ryn also prevents Ryn from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security with the exception of Ryn purchasing or selling securities for his own personal accounts. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n \n      The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force have issued an\u00a0Investor Alert\u00a0with tips on how investors should avoid investment decisions based solely on common ties with someone recommending or selling the investment.\n \n      The SEC's investigation was led by Adrienne Adkins, Rebecca Schendel Norris, and Jonathan Shapiro and supervised by Amy Friedman and Carolyn Welshhans, with the litigation led by James Carlson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the New York Division of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.\n\n      \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      SEC Complaint\n      \n\n  \n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Eric J. \"EJ\" Dalius et al., Civil Action No. 2:18-cv-08497 (C.D. Ca. filed Oct. 3, 2018)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the resolution of its fraud action against Eric J. \"EJ\" Dalius and the business he owned, Saivian LLC. Dalius and Saivian LLC have agreed to pay $24 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties to settle the SEC's claims against them for operating a multi-million dollar Ponzi and pyramid scheme, and offering fraud. The SEC's litigation against Ryan Morgan Evans, a top executive in the Saivian scheme, is ongoing.\n \n      The SEC's complaint alleged that, beginning in October 2015, Dalius and the companies he controlled under the umbrella name \"Saivian\" sold securities that entitled holders to receive 20 percent cash back on their retail shopping purchases every month in exchange for paying a $125 fee every 28 days and the submission of shopping receipts. The SEC's investigation uncovered that Dalius and Saivian falsely claimed that the company funded these cash back payments to members by monetizing the point-of-sale receipt data submitted by its members. Instead, they allegedly operated a Ponzi scheme by satisfying promised returns to some investors through the investments of others. Dalius and Saivian also allegedly operated a pyramid scheme that promised a daily residual income stream for affiliates who sold Saivian memberships to downline recruits. Dalius also allegedly hid his creation and ownership of the Saivian scheme and failed to disclose his 2001 criminal conviction for carrying out a prior multi-level marketing fraud to investors.\n \n      The settlement requires Dalius and Saivian LLC to jointly and severally disgorge $20,080,784.41 (the net profits of the Saivian enterprise) plus prejudgment interest of $919,215.59, and to each pay a $1,500,000 civil penalty.  Dalius and Saivian LLC have agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The SEC intends to establish a Fair Fund to distribute the money received from the defendants to harmed investors.\n \n      The SEC's investigation was conducted by Geoffrey Gettinger, Michael Flanagan and Margaret Vizzi, and was supervised by Ivonia Slade and Melissa Hodgman.\u00a0The litigation was conducted by David Nasse, Derek Bentsen, Kenneth Donnelly and the investigative team.

Joshua W. Coleman, No. 2:23-cv-00459 (E.D. Pa. filed Feb. 6, 2023)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Joshua W. Coleman, resident of North Wales, Pennsylvania and former investment adviser, for perpetrating a fraudulent scheme that yielded him over $200 million in illicit loan proceeds.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint, Coleman entered into six successive loan transactions between December 2018 and June 2022 and diverted the proceeds for his personal use, including financing personal investments and paying outstanding business expenses.  Coleman's scheme allegedly involved a wide range of misconduct, including forging signatures on loan documents, lying to advisory clients, and fabricating and altering emails, bank statements, and other documents.  The complaint alleges that Coleman obtained the initial loans in part by pledging as collateral over $160 million in advisory client assets, a portion of which were seized by Coleman's lender after Coleman defaulted.  The complaint further alleges that, to repay these clients, Coleman procured additional loans by pledging his own securities as collateral while misleading his new lenders concerning the purpose of the loans and the value of certain pledged collateral.  According to the complaint, Coleman defaulted on those loan transactions and owes over $50 million in proceeds.\n \n      The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, charges Coleman with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, as well as Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 promulgated thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Coleman has agreed to the entry of a judgment, subject to court approval, imposing a permanent injunction and an officer-and-director bar, while reserving the issue of disgorgement and a civil penalty for further determination by the court.  Coleman also has agreed to\u00a0the imposition of associational\u00a0and\u00a0penny stock\u00a0bars\u00a0as part of a settled follow-on administrative proceeding.\n \n      The SEC's investigation was conducted by Matthew Homberger, Brian Higgins, and Brendan McGlynn, each of the Philadelphia Regional Office.  The investigation resulted from a referral by Eric Elefante, Scott Fisher, Daniel Faigus, and Brian Carroll of the Division of\u00a0Examinations.

The complaint also alleged that despite the promotion of Mindset 24 as a legitimate enterprise, it was nothing more than a fraudulent pyramid scheme.\n \n      McLane and Nash both consented to entry of final judgments, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and the securities offering registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act, and from engaging in conduct indicative of a pyramid scheme.  In addition, McLane was ordered to pay disgorgement of $135,200, plus prejudgment interest of $17,770, and Nash was ordered to pay disgorgement of $173,600, plus prejudgment interest of $22,817.  Both defendants also were ordered to pay civil penalties of $60,000.\n \n      The SEC's investigation was conducted by Benjamin Perlman and supervised by Nina B. Finston and Carolyn M. Welshhans.  The litigation was conducted by Patrick Costello and supervised by James Carlson.\n \n      The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00a0Investor Alert\u00a0to encourage investors to be aware of indications that a pyramid scheme may be posing as a multi-level marketing program.\n\n      \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      SEC Complaint\n        Judgment - Nash\n        Judgment - McLane\n      \n\n  \n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     SEC Complaint\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Judgment - Nash\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Judgment - McLane\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

In 2018, the SEC charged Gil de Rubio and two other defendants with fraud and misappropriation through sales of securities in a company that falsely claimed to have exclusive rights to a crude oil processing technology.

Abujudeh, Civil Action No. 1:21-cv-04110 (E.D.N.Y. filed July 22, 2021)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      On January 20, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment against California resident Charlie Abujudeh whom the SEC had charged for his role in a microcap fraud scheme targeting retail investors.  Among other things, the judgment orders Abujudeh to pay a total of over $5 million.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 22, 2021, from August 2019 to at least September 2020, Abujudeh worked with others to fraudulently sell several microcap companies' stock to investors by making misleading statements during high pressure sales calls and/or email promotions. The SEC alleges that, as part of the scheme, Abujudeh and his associates convinced investors to invest in the stock of Odyssey Group International, Inc., as well as other microcap companies, including Scepter Holdings, Inc., and CannaPharmaRx, Inc. Abujudeh paid stock promoters to tout Odyssey stock over the phone to unsuspecting retail investors who were recruited through false and misleading representations. Abujudeh also allegedly paid for email promotional campaigns and schemed to hide his control over and simultaneous sale of Odyssey, Scepter, and CannaPharmaRx stock into the increased demand that the promotions he paid for had generated. The SEC's complaint alleges that Abujudeh funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars of the illegal Odyssey stock sale proceeds to an Odyssey insider with whom he had been coordinating.\n \n      Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Abujudeh consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the registration provisions of Section 5 and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Abujudeh also consented to the imposition of a five-year penny stock bar, a five-year officer-and-director bar, disgorgement of $5,423,045 and prejudgment interest of $115,993, and a $414,366 civil penalty.\n \n      The SEC's case against Abujudeh was handled by David D'Addio, Nita Klunder, and Paul Block of the Boston Regional Office.

According to the complaint, the frequent trading coupled with commissions and other fees, resulted in a high-cost strategy through which customers suffered losses, while generating significant profits for Clay and Reagan.  The complaint further alleges that Reagan also engaged in this conduct at another firm from March 2020 to April 2021.\n \n      Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Clay consented to entry of a final judgment in the district court action, permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $150,898, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $22,936; and a civil monetary penalty of $150,898.

Investigations into other securities law violations and into other entities and persons relating to the alleged misconduct are ongoing.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint, between 2019 and 2022, Ellison, at the direction of Bankman-Fried, furthered the scheme by manipulating the price of FTT, an FTX-issued exchange crypto security token, by purchasing large quantities on the open market to prop up its price. FTT served as collateral for undisclosed loans by FTX of its customers' assets to Alameda, a crypto hedge fund owned by Wang and Bankman-Fried and run by Ellison. The complaint alleges that, by manipulating the price of FTT, Bankman-Fried and Ellison caused the valuation of Alameda's FTT holdings to be inflated, which in turn caused the value of collateral on Alameda's balance sheet to be overstated, and misled investors about FTX's risk exposure.\n \n      In addition, the complaint alleges that, from at least May 2019 until November 2022, Bankman-Fried raised billions of dollars from investors by falsely touting FTX as a safe crypto asset trading platform with sophisticated risk mitigation measures to protect customer assets and by telling investors that Alameda was just another customer with no special privileges; meanwhile, Bankman-Fried and Wang improperly diverted FTX customer assets to Alameda. The complaint alleges that Ellison and Wang knew or should have known that such statements were false and misleading.\n \n      The complaint also alleges that Ellison and Wang were active participants in the scheme to deceive FTX's investors and engaged in conduct that was critical to its success. The complaint alleges that Wang created FTX's software code that allowed Alameda to divert FTX customer funds, and Ellison used misappropriated FTX customer funds for Alameda's trading activity. The complaint further alleges that, even as it became clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole, Bankman-Fried, with the knowledge of Ellison and Wang, directed hundreds of millions of dollars more in FTX customer funds to Alameda.\n \n      The SEC's complaint charges Ellison and Wang with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. The SEC's complaint seeks injunctions against future securities law violations; an injunction that prohibits Ellison and Wang from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, except for their own personal accounts; disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains; a civil penalty; and an officer and director bar. Ellison and Wang have consented to bifurcated settlements, which are subject to court approval, under which they will be permanently enjoined from violating the federal securities laws, the above-described conduct-based injunctions, and officer and director bars. Upon motion of the SEC, the court will determine whether and what amount of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and/or a civil penalty is appropriate, as well as the length of the officer and director bar and the conduct-based injunction imposed against Wang.\n \n      In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced charges against Ellison and Wang.\n \n      Ellison and Wang are cooperating with the SEC's ongoing investigation, which is being conducted by Devlin N. Su, Ivan Snyder, and David S. Brown of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and Brian Huchro and Pasha Salimi. It is being supervised by Amy Flaherty Hartman, Michael Brennan, Jorge Tenreiro, and David Hirsch. The SEC's litigation will be led by Amy Burkart and David D'Addio and supervised by Ladan Stewart and Olivia Choe. Additional assistance to the investigation was provided by Therese Scheuer, Alistaire Bambach, Ainsley Kerr, William Connolly, and Howard Kaplan.\n \n      The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\n      \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      SEC Complaint\n      \n\n  \n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     SEC Complaint\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

The District Court had previously entered a partial judgment against Zinkwich, imposing multiple injunctions against him.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint, from at least June 2017 to March 2018, individuals and groups who held large quantities of microcap stocks paid Zinkwich hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate a scheme to drive up demand for the stocks of certain issuers. As alleged in the complaint, Zinkwich arranged for his associate Eric Landis to generate an appearance of increased demand for the stocks by placing thousands of trades between numerous accounts under Landis's control, including accounts that Zinkwich controlled and gave Landis access to.  The Commission separately charged and obtained a final judgment against Landis for his role in the fraud. In the complaints against Zinkwich and Landis, the SEC alleged that the manipulative trading scheme generated the false appearance of an upsurge of trading in the companies' stock and allowed Zinkwich's clients to sell millions of shares of stock into the public market at inflated prices.\n \n      Zinkwich has consented to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the market manipulation and antifraud provisions of Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from participating in any offering of penny stock.

Gerard R. Hug and Kurt W. Streams, 2:19-cv-16290-ES-JRA (D.N.J. filed Aug. 2, 2019)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      On November 30, 2022 and December 13, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entered Final Judgments against Gerard R. Hug and Kurt W. Streams, former executives of SITO Mobile, Ltd., a mobile advertising provider based in Jersey City, New Jersey.\n \n      The SEC's complaint filed on August 5, 2019 alleges that SITO's former CFO, Kurt W. Streams, fraudulently used SITO funds to pay for at least $200,000 of personal living expenses, including his Netflix and Amazon Prime subscriptions, pet groomers, eyewear, and vacations.  Similarly, the SEC's amended complaint filed on December 7, 2022 alleges that SITO's former CEO, Gerard R. Hug, improperly charged SITO's corporate credit card with approximately $77,000 in personal expenses, and approximately $160,000 in expenses that had no apparent business purpose or for which Hug did not provide sufficient verification.  The amended complaint further alleges that Hug regularly used SITO's corporate credit card to pay for personal expenses such as family vacations, sporting tickets, designer clothes, luxury items, donations to his son's private school, and college living expenses for his daughter.\n \n      Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Streams consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 of the Exchange Act; and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 14a-3 and 14a-9 thereunder; ordering Streams to pay disgorgement in the amount of $48,796.00 and a civil penalty in the amount of $20,204.00; and ordering a two-year officer-and-director bar .  On January 13, 2023, the Commission issued an administrative order barring Streams from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 102(e).\n \n      Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hug consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Sections 13(b)(5) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2, 14a-3, and 14a-9 thereunder; and ordering a $50,000 civil penalty.\n \n      The SEC's investigation was conducted and supervised by Kevin Guerrero.

According to the filing, in or around November 2020, threat actors associated with the Microsoft Hafnium cyberattack maliciously and unlawfully obtained access to Covington's computer network and certain individual devices, including access to non-public files of nearly 300 Covington clients that are regulated by the SEC.  The SEC learned of the cyberattack on Covington in early 2022 and issued the subpoena soon thereafter.  Through its subpoena enforcement action, the SEC is seeking only the names of those clients whose files were viewed, copied, modified or exfiltrated by the threat actors.  According to the filing, the SEC seeks this information to assist it in identifying any suspicious trading by the threat actors or others in those clients' securities, and whether such trading was illegal based on material non-public information that the threat actors viewed or exfiltrated as part of the cyberattack.  In addition, the information will assist the SEC in determining whether the impacted clients made all required disclosures to the investing public about any material cybersecurity events in connection with the cyberattack.  To date, Covington has refused to provide the names of all but two of the clients, and those two clients consented to providing their names to the SEC.\n \n      The SEC's application seeks an order from the court directing Covington to show cause as to why the court should not compel it to produce the documents as required by the subpoena. The application further seeks an order from the court, following its ruling on the order to show cause, directing Covington to comply with the subpoena. The application is subject to the court's ruling.  The SEC is continuing its fact-finding investigation and, to date, has not concluded that any individual or entity has violated the federal securities laws.\n\n      \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        Application\n        \n  \n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     Application\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Jason Sugarman, No. 19-cv-5998 (S.D.N.Y., filed June 26, 2019)\n\n\n\nSEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Defendant Charged in $43 Million Tribal Bonds Scheme\n\n\n\nOn January 10, 2023, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final consent judgment against defendant Jason Sugarman, ordering him to pay over $10.2 million dollars in disgorgement, interest, and penalties. The judgment resolves the SEC\u2019s charges against Sugarman for his role in a scheme to defraud ten pension funds out of $43 million in connection with the issuance of limited recourse Native American tribal bonds between 2014 and 2015.\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s complaint(filed on June 27, 2019, and amended on November 2, 2022) Sugarman, and his partner Jason Galanis, acquired control of two investment advisers so that they and their associates could use the advisers\u2019 clients\u2019 funds to purchase Native American tribal bonds. While the bond sale proceeds were supposed to be invested in annuities to benefit the tribal corporation and repay the bondholders, the complaint alleged that Sugarman and his associates instead misappropriated the proceeds for their own benefit, including using proceeds of the initial round of bond sales to finance the acquisition of a foreign insurance company that was, in turn, used to acquire the second investment adviser used in the scheme.\n\nThis action followed the SEC\u2019s case against eight other participants in the scheme, SEC v. Archer, 16 Civ. 3505 (GHW) (OTW) (S.D.N.Y.), and the criminal indictments and convictions of seven of those defendants, including Galanis, in a parallel criminal case, United States v. Galanis, 16 Cr. 371 (RA) (S.D.N.Y.).\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Sugarman consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder; ordering him to pay disgorgement in the amount of $7,157,232.19, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $1,317,703.82, and $1,789,308.05 in civil penalties; and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for three years.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by Tejal D. Shah, Nancy A. Brown, Christopher Ferrante, and Adam S. Grace of the SEC\u2019s New York Regional Office, under the supervision of Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC\u2019s litigation was led by Ms. Brown, Ms. Shah and Mariel Bronen, under the supervision of Sheldon L. Pollock, and with the assistance of Alistaire Bambach and Therese A.

Cooper J. Morgenthau, Civil Action No. 1:23-cv-00022 (S.D.N.Y. filed Jan. 3, 2023)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      The Securities and Exchange Commission announced on January 3, 2023, fraud charges against Cooper J. Morgenthau, the former CFO of African Gold Acquisition Corp., a SPAC or special purpose acquisition company, for orchestrating a scheme in which he stole more than $5 million from the company and from investors in two other SPACs that he incorporated.\n \n      The SEC's complaint alleges that, from June 2021 through July 2022, Morgenthau embezzled money from African Gold and stole funds from another SPAC series called Strategic Metals Acquisition Corp. I and II to pay for his personal expenses and to trade in crypto assets and other securities.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint, Morgenthau concealed unauthorized withdrawals by falsifying African Gold's bank account statements and then provided those falsified documents to African Gold's auditor and accountants for purposes of preparing African Gold's SEC filings. During the same general time period, Morgenthau raised money from Strategic Metals' investors based on misrepresentations that the money would be used to launch the Strategic Metals SPACs, when in fact Morgenthau misappropriated the money for personal uses, including to conceal his embezzlement of African Gold's funds.\n \n      The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Morgenthau violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, 13b2-2(a) and (b), and 13a-14 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. Morgenthau consented to a judgment enjoining him from further federal securities laws violations and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company, with monetary remedies to be determined at a later date.\n \n      In a parallel action, on January 3, 2023, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Morgenthau.\n \n      The case is being led by David D'Addio, Anne Hancock, Ryan Murphy, and Amy Gwiazda of the Boston Regional Office.

(\"CodeSmart\").  The SEC alleged that Wexler and others sought to flood the market with CodeSmart shares and engaged in a promotional campaign to artificially inflate the price of the stock.  Meanwhile Bell and another individual invested their brokerage clients in CodeSmart.  In short, the SEC alleged that the plan was for the defendants to profit at the expense of Bell's brokerage clients.\n \n      The SEC's complaint charged Wexler and Bell with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In reality, the shell companies either did not own, or were not permitted to transfer, interests in the company.  The SEC's complaint also alleged that Paul Hess and Michael Liberty lied to investors about Mozido's valuation and finances, the amount Michael Liberty had personally invested in Mozido, and the use of their funds.  In total, Hess, Liberty, and the other co-defendants fraudulently raised more than $48 million from 2010 through 2016.\n \n      Hess consented to a final judgment in the SEC action that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; the broker-dealer registration requirements of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and the securities offering registration requirements of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.  The judgment also prohibits Hess from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security with the exception of Hess purchasing or selling securities for his own personal accounts, and finds him liable for disgorgement of $2,382,116, prejudgment interest of $434,670, and a civil penalty of $160,000.\n \n      The SEC's case, which remains ongoing against Liberty and other defendants, is being handled by Peter Bryan Moores, Marc Jones, and Kevin Currid of the Boston Regional Office.\n\n      \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      Judgment - Paul Hess\n      \n\n  \n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     Judgment - Paul Hess\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

The complaint alleged that ten Cate and his now-defunct private company, Xcalibur Aerospace, Ltd., placed an advertisement in The New York Times announcing a proposed plan to purchase all existing stock of Textron, Inc., at a 56% premium over the stock's previous closing price.  The announcement allegedly contained a number of false and misleading statements about Xcalibur's size and financial condition and failed to disclose that ten Cate and entities he controlled had been the subject of multiple bankruptcy and default judgments.\n \n      Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ten Cate consented to entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; imposing a permanent conduct-based injunction that will prevent him from, among other things, participating in any securities offerings; permanently barring him from acting as an officer or director of a public company; and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $500,000.

Conrad A. Coggeshall, Defendant, and Business Owners Tax Relief, LLC, Relief Defendant, No. 2:19-cv-05667 (D. Ariz. filed Nov. 22, 2019)\n\n\nOn December 16, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona entered final judgment by default against Conrad Coggeshall in a previously-filed SEC case that alleged Coggeshall fraudulently raised $700,000 from elderly investors. According to the complaint, Coggeshall told investors they were investing in Business Owners Tax Relief, LLC (\"BOTR\"), a purportedly successful mergers and acquisitions firm based in New York, when he actually deposited investors' funds into brokerage and bank accounts for an Arizona company he owns with the same name and then used investor funds to trade securities, incurring significant losses, pay personal expenses, and make payments to investors which he falsely represented were interest payments.\n\nThe final judgment against Coggeshall permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\"). It also orders him to pay a civil penalty of $385,536. The final judgment also found Coggeshall liable for disgorgement of $592,546, which represents net profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the complaint, plus $100,299.73 in prejudgment interest, but deemed the disgorgement and prejudgment interest satisfied by the judgment of default entered against Coggeshall and BOTR by the Arizona Corporation Commission in In the Matter of Conrad Coggeshall and Business Owners Tax Relief, LLC, Docket No. S-21103A-20-0095 (October 2, 2020). At the SEC's request, the court also dismissed with prejudice the SEC's claims against Relief Defendant BOTR.\n\nThe Court had previously entered judgments by consent against Coggeshall and BOTR, which: (i) permanently enjoined Coggeshall from violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; and (ii) ordered that Coggeshall and BOTR pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and that Coggeshall pay a civil penalty, in amounts to be determined by the Court upon motion of the SEC. Coggeshall and BOTR consented to these judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was led by Robert M. Moye and Jen Peltz and was supervised by John E. Birkenheier and Daniel Hayes. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Corporation Commission, Securities Division and the Arizona Attorney General.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tJudgment\n\n\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Medsis International, Inc. et al., Civil Action No. 1:21-cv-11356 (D. Mass. filed Aug. 19, 2021)\n\n\nOn December 21, 2022, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Paul Hess ordering him to pay approximately $840,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleged that Hess partnered with co-defendant Joshua Dax Cabrera to fraudulently raise more than $12.9 million from more than 150 U.S. and foreign investors by offering unregistered securities in Medsis International, Inc. from 2015 through 2020. The complaint alleged that while offering Medsis securities, Hess and Cabrera made multiple material misrepresentations and misleading statements about Medsis to investors concerning the existence and value of contracts with customers, existing and expected revenue, and business operations. The complaint also alleged that Hess and Cabrera misrepresented to investors their personal use of investor funds.\n\nHess consented to a final judgment in the SEC action that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; the broker-dealer registration requirements of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and the securities offering registration requirements of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The judgment also prohibits Hess from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security with the exception of Hess purchasing or selling securities for his own personal accounts, and finds him liable for disgorgement of $527,000, prejudgment interest of $109,205, and a civil penalty of $207,183.\n\nThe SEC's case, which remains ongoing against Cabrera and Medsis, is being handled by Peter Bryan Moores, Trevor Donelan, Marc Jones, and Kevin Currid of the Boston Regional Office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tJudgment\n\n\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Knox et al., Civil Action No. 1:18-cv-12058 (D.\u00a0Mass. filed Oct. 2, 2018)\n\n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it obtained final judgments against Roger Knox and an entity he controlled for their role in an international scheme that generated more than $165 million of illegal sales of stock on the U.S. markets in at least 50 microcap companies. The final judgments impose multiple injunctions against Knox and his entity Wintercap SA and find them liable for over $6 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.\n \n      According to the SEC's complaint filed in October 2018, Knox and Wintercap helped microcap securities holders evade federal securities laws that restrict sales by large shareholders. The complaint charged that Knox and Wintercap helped sellers conceal their stock ownership and provided anonymous access to brokerage accounts to sell the shares on the U.S. markets. In a parallel criminal action brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, a federal grand jury in Massachusetts indicted Knox on one count of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Knox pled guilty in January 2020. His sentencing remains pending.\n \n      The SEC's complaint also charged Michael Gastauer for aiding and abetting the fraud by establishing several U.S. corporations and allowing Knox to use their bank accounts to disburse the proceeds of his illegal stock sales. The complaint named as relief defendants two family members of Gastauer and a U.K. entity Gastauer controlled. After the SEC filed the case, the court entered a preliminary injunction and continued an asset freeze against Knox, Gastauer, and the entities they used in the scheme. In March and June 2022, the court entered final judgments against Gastauer and against various entities he controlled, imposing injunctions against them and ordering them to pay over $30 million in disgorgement and civil penalties. In October 2022, the court entered a final judgment against relief defendant Raimund Gastauer, ordering him to pay $3,920,144 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. Raimund Gastauer's appeal of that judgment remains pending. And in December 2022, the SEC filed a motion to dismiss its claims against relief defendant Shamal International FZE.\n \n      The final judgments against Knox and Wintercap SA permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, from violating the antifraud provisions and broker registration provisions of Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from participating in any offering of penny stock. The final judgments also find Knox and Wintercap SA jointly and severally liable for over $6 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and deem those sums satisfied by payment of previously frozen assets in the amount of $891,235 and the orders of forfeiture in Knox's criminal case totaling approximately $11 million.\n \n      The SEC's case against Knox, Gastauer, and others has been handled at various stages by Trevor Donelan, Kathleen Shields, J. Lauchlan Wash, Jonathan Allen, David Scheffler, Nita Klunder, and Amy Gwiazda in the Boston Regional Office.\n\n      \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      Judgment - Roger Knox\n        Judgment - Wintercap SA\n      \n\n  \n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     Judgment - Roger Knox\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Judgment - Wintercap SA\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Justin W. Keener d/b/a JMJ Financial, No. 1:20-cv-21254 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 20, 2022)\n\n\nOn December 20, 2022, Judge Beth Bloom of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against Justin W. Keener d/b/a JMJ Financial. The SEC's complaint alleged that Keener failed to register as a securities dealer with the SEC, or to associate with a registered dealer, when he bought and sold billions of newly issued shares of penny stock from at least January 2015 through January 2018. Keener obtained the shares directly from issuers after converting debt securities known as convertible notes. By failing to register, Keener avoided certain regulatory obligations\u00a0for dealers\u00a0that govern their conduct in the marketplace, including regulatory inspections and oversight, financial responsibility requirements, and maintaining books and records.\n\nThe court previously granted summary judgment to the Commission. On January 21, 2022, the court ruled that Keener met the statutory definition of dealer because he operated a regular business of buying and selling securities for his own account.\u00a0The court found that his failure to register as a dealer, or associate with a registered dealer, violated the dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIn its final judgment, the court ordered Keener to pay disgorgement of $7,786,639, prejudgment interest of $1,425,266, and a civil penalty of $1,030,000, for a total judgment of $10,241,905. The court also entered a permanent injunction and five year penny stock bar against Keener, and ordered him to surrender for cancellation certain stock and conversion rights under existing convertible securities.\n\nThe SEC is represented by Joshua E.

George Iakovou, Vika Ventures LLC, and Penelope Zbravos, Civ. Action, o. 4:22-cv-00194-CDL (M.D. Ga. filed Dec. 7, 2022)\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission charged CEO George Iakovou and his venture capital firm, Vika Ventures LLC, with fraudulently offering and selling more than $6 million of securities to at least 46 individual investors in multiple states including California, Georgia, and New York. The SEC also announced settled charges against Penelope Zbravos for her role in Vika Ventures.\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that, between late 2019 and 2021, Iakovou and Vika Ventures offered to sell investors shares of private companies that might hold an initial public offering. However, as set forth in the SEC's complaint, Iakovou and Vika Ventures did not own the shares at the time of the solicitations and never acquired them. Rather than purchasing the securities, Iakovou allegedly used investor funds for himself. As CEO of Vika Ventures, Iakovou allegedly used fraudulent documentation and statements to convince investors that Vika Ventures was a successful venture capital firm. According to the SEC's complaint, Zbravos, Iakovou's then-girlfriend, encountered sufficient red flags regarding the company's operations to make her a negligent participant in Vika Ventures.\n\nThe complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, charges Iakovou and Vika Ventures with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 and charges Zbravos with violating Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act. The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Iakovou and Zbravos and an officer and director bar against Iakovou. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief and a civil penalty against Vika Ventures.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Zbravos has agreed to a permanent injunction from future violations of Section 17(a)(3) and to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty, as determined by the district court. The settlement is subject to the approval of the district court.\n\nIn a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Georgia, filed related criminal charges.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Allison M. Rochford and Michelle I. Bougdanos and supervised by David Frohlich and Carolyn Welshhans. The litigation will be led by James Carlson.

Mass. filed Nov. 27, 2018)\n\n\nOn December\u00a05, 2022, the U.S. District Court in Boston entered a final judgment against Virginia resident Eric T. Landis, a recidivist market manipulator, and an entity he controlled, ordering them to pay over $2.5 million in disgorgement and deeming that amount satisfied by the same amount ordered as forfeiture in a parallel criminal action. The District Court had previously entered judgments against Landis and his entity, Ridgeview Capital Markets LLC, imposing multiple injunctions against them.\n\nAccording to the SEC's Complaint, filed in November 2018, Landis orchestrated a scheme to manipulate trading in at least 97 microcap stocks, which included placing thousands of manipulative trades over the course of three years using multiple accounts he controlled, including accounts in the name of Ridgeview. In August 2019, the court entered judgments by consent against Landis and Ridgeview\u00a0that imposed multiple injunctions restricting their future conduct.\n\nLandis was sentenced on January 24, 2020, in a parallel criminal action to six months in prison and two years of supervised release, and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine. The court later ordered Landis to pay forfeiture of $2,505,488. Landis had pleaded guilty in January 2019 to one count of securities fraud and one count of aiding and abetting securities fraud.\n\nLandis and Ridgeview have consented to a final judgment in the SEC action that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the market manipulation provisions of Section 9(a) of the Exchange Act. The judgment also prohibits Landis and Ridgeview from promoting or participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including penny stocks, with the exception for Landis trading in his own name in securities listed on a national securities exchange, and finds them jointly-and-severally liable for disgorgement of $2,505,488, which the court deemed satisfied by the order of forfeiture against Landis in the related criminal proceeding.\n\nLandis was previously found liable in 2003 in a lawsuit brought by the SEC and convicted of related criminal charges in a prior market manipulation scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSEC Complaint\n\tJudgment\n\n\n\n\n      \n                                  \n              \n    \n\n          \n                \n\n  Resources\n    \n      \n              \n    \n     SEC Complaint\n  \n\n              \n    \n    Judgment\n---\n\nPredict the following outcomes for this case:\n\n1.

Yinghang \"James\" Yang and Yuanbiao Chen, No. 20-cv-4427 (E.D.N.Y. filed Sept. 21, 2020)\n\n\nOn November 9 and 28, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered final judgments against Yinghang \"James\" Yang, a former senior index manager at a globally recognized index provider, and Yuanbiao Chen, a sushi restaurant owner, in the Commission's insider trading case against them. The final judgments enjoin Yang and Chen from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and order Chen to pay a $246,000 civil monetary penalty.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, between June and October 2019, Yang and Chen repeatedly purchased call or put options of publicly traded companies hours before public announcements that those companies would be added to, or removed from, popular stock market indices, which Yang learned through his employment. When the options increased in value after the announcements, Yang and Chen allegedly liquidated their options positions, generating approximately $912,082 in illicit profits. As alleged in the complaint, the defendants used Chen's brokerage account to conceal the trading from Yang's employer, which required disclosure of all employee brokerage accounts.\n\nThe final judgments against Yang and Chen permanently enjoin each of them from violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and order Chen to pay a $246,000 civil monetary penalty.\n\nIn July 2022, in a parallel criminal action by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, the Court sentenced Yang to time served followed by one year of supervised release, three months of home detention, 100 hours of community service, mandatory financial disclosures to the Department of Probation, and a $100 special assessment. The Court also entered a forfeiture order against Yang for $912,082.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was handled by Mary Kay Dunning and Tian Wen and supervised by Alexander Vasilescu and Sheldon L. Pollock.

William Sadleir, No. 1:20-cv-03997 (S.D.N.Y. filed May 22, 2020)\n\n\nOn November 25, 2022, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final consent judgment against William Sadleir, the former Beverly Hills owner of a defunct film distribution company accused of defrauding a publicly traded fund out of at least $13.8 million.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed on May 22, 2020, alleged that BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust (BIT), a registered closed-end management investment company, invested approximately $75 million in Aviron Group LLC, a film distribution company Sadleir founded, owned, and operated. The complaint alleged that Sadleir represented that the investments would be used to support the company's distribution of films. Contrary to these representations, Sadleir allegedly used a sham company as a vehicle to fraudulently divert and misappropriate BIT funds and issued fake invoices seeking additional BIT funds for services that were never provided. Sadleir allegedly used the funds to pay personal expenses, including his purchase, furnishing, and renovation of a Beverly Hills mansion. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York filed criminal charges against Sadleir in connection with similar conduct. United States v. William Sadleir, No. 20-cr-0320 (S.D.N.Y. filed May 22, 2020).\n\nOn January 19, 2022, Sadleir pled guilty in the criminal matter, and on May 6, 2022, Sadleir consented to a partial judgment in the SEC matter in which he was permanently enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and enjoined from participating in the issuance, offer, or sale of any security, except in his own account.\u00a0 The final judgment in the SEC matter orders Sadleir to pay disgorgement of $13,834,239 plus prejudgment interest of $3,979,140 for a total of $17,813,379, which shall be deemed satisfied by the restitution order entered against Sadleir in the criminal case. On September 9, 2022, the court in the criminal case sentenced Sadleir to 72 months in prison and ordered him to pay restitution of $31.6 million. On September 22, 2022, the court further ordered Sadleir to forfeit a Tesla he acquired from his misconduct.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Salvatore Massa and Brian Fitzpatrick of the Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit and Kerri L.

Ruben James Rojas, No. 5:19-cv-01799 (C.D.

Rojas approved the bond offering materials provided to investors despite the fact that they misleadingly attached a clean prior-year audit opinion without disclosing that the auditor had been terminated after raising concerns.\n\nOn November 18, 2022, the Honorable Fernando Aenlle-Rocha, entered an amended final judgment permanently enjoining Rojas from participation in municipal securities offerings and from violating Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. The amended final judgment also orders Rojas to pay a civil penalty of $50,000. In consenting to entry of the amended final judgment, Rojas admitted to conduct in violation of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act.\n\nThe court's entry of the amended final judgment resolves this litigation in its entirety.\n\nThe SEC's litigation was conducted by Brent Smyth, Andrew Hefty, Marc Katz and Matthew Meyerhofer of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office.

On October 28, 2022, a final consent judgment was entered against Fernando Moraes, the former Chief Operating Officer of Holzer's family office, who was also previously charged with insider trading.\n\nThe SEC's complaints, filed on September 30, 2022, alleged that Holzer and Moraes traded in options of Dun & Bradstreet Corp. (NYSE: DNB) based on material nonpublic information ahead of the company's August 8, 2018 announcement that it had agreed to be acquired by a private investor group at a price of $145 per share, realizing ill-gotten profits of $96,091 and $8,842, respectively. The SEC alleged that Holzer and Moraes learned about the pending acquisition from a member of the investor group pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement, and that in addition to trading for themselves, Holzer and Moraes unlawfully tipped two other traders who realized profits of $672,000 and $65,332, respectively.\n\nOn October 4, 2022, Holzer consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to a judgment in which he was permanently enjoined from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and barred from acting as an officer or director of a public issuer. The final judgment entered on November 14, 2022 orders Holzer to pay disgorgement of $91,509 plus prejudgment interest of $14,217.67 and a civil penalty of $763,509.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations, Moraes consented to the entry of a final consent judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act, orders him to pay disgorgement of $8,842 plus prejudgment interest of $1,647, and a civil penalty of $48,646, and bars him from acting as an officer or director of a public issuer.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Derek Schoenmann and Elizabeth Baier of the New York Regional Office with assistance from Richard Hong of the Trial Unit.

Infinity Q Diversified Alpha Fund, No. 22-civ-09608 (S.D.N.Y. filed November 10, 2022)\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled action against the Infinity Q Diversified Alpha Mutual Fund for mispricing its net asset value, or \"NAV,\" as part of a massive overvaluation scheme, and is seeking in its complaint an order appointing a Special Master over the mutual fund to oversee the return of remaining funds to harmed investors.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, from at least February 2017 through February 2021, the mutual fund's reported NAVs were materially and falsely inflated due to a mismarking scheme conducted by James Velissaris, the Chief Investment Officer of Infinity Q Capital Management, LLC, the investment adviser to the mutual fund. Velissaris was previously charged by the SEC for this conduct. On February 22, 2021, Infinity Q and the mutual fund's board filed an application for an order pursuant to Section 22(e)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 to suspend redemptions in the mutual fund, which was approved by the SEC that same day. The mutual fund was subsequently liquidated, and, to date, the mutual fund has distributed approximately $670 million to current shareholders, with approximately $570 million remaining to be distributed to harmed investors.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed today in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges the mutual fund with violating the pricing provisions of Rule 22c-1 of the Investment Company Act. The mutual fund has agreed to settle the charges and consent to the appointment of the Special Master to oversee expenses paid from the mutual fund and to administer a process to return the remaining funds to harmed investors. The settlement, which permanently enjoins the mutual fund from violating Rule 22c-1, and the appointment of the Special Master, are subject to court approval.\n\nThe SEC's ongoing investigation is being conducted by David H. Tutor of the Asset Management Unit, Joshua Brodsky of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit, and Kerri Palen, James Addison, and Neal Jacobson of the New York Regional Office. It is being supervised by Andrew Dean, Co-Chief of the Asset Management Unit, Osman Nawaz, Chief of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit, and Alistaire Bambach, Chief Bankruptcy Counsel to the Division of Enforcement.

Brian Wong, No. 22-cv-09618 (S.D.N.Y. filed November 10, 2022)\n\n\nOn November 10, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed insider trading charges against Brian Wong of Secaucus, New Jersey for trading on inside information tipped to him by his brother, Brandon Wong. The SEC previously charged Brandon Wong and his source, Seth Markin, with insider trading on July 25, 2022.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Brian Wong made approximately $400,000 from illegally trading ahead of a February 2021 announcement of a tender offer by Merck & Co., Inc. to acquire Pandion Therapeutics, Inc. The SEC's complaint alleges that Brian Wong's brother, Brandon Wong, unlawfully communicated material nonpublic information about Merck's impending acquisition of Pandion to Brian Wong before the February 2021 announcement, and that Brian Wong purchased Pandion stock based on that information. As previously alleged in the SEC's July 25, 2022 complaint, Brandon Wong had been tipped about the impending acquisition by his friend Seth Markin, who had misappropriated the information from Markin's romantic partner, an attorney working on the deal.\n\nThe SEC's complaint charges Brian Wong with violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and of Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties. Subject to court approval, Brian Wong has consented to the entry of injunctive relief, with monetary remedies to be determined at a later date, upon a motion by the SEC.\n\nThe case originated from the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious trading patterns.\n\nIn a related action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York filed criminal charges against Brian Wong.\n\nThe SEC's investigation, which is continuing, was conducted by Tracy Sivitz, Chevon Walker, John Rymas, and Simona Suh of the Market Abuse Unit, and by Neil Hendelman of the New York Regional Office. This case has been supervised by Market Abuse Unit Chief Joseph G. Sansone. Mses. Sivitz, Walker, and Suh will lead the SEC's litigation.

Douver Torres Braga, Joff Paradise, and Keleionalani Akana Taylor, No. 2:22-cv-01563 (W.D. Wash. filed Nov. 3, 2022)\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission v. Jonathan Tetreault, No. 2:22-cv-01567 (W.D. Wash. filed Nov. 3, 2022)\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Douver Torres Braga, Joff Paradise, Keleionalani Akana Taylor, and Jonathan Tetreault for their roles in Trade Coin Club, a fraudulent crypto Ponzi scheme that raised more than 82,000 bitcoin, valued at $295 million at the time, from more than 100,000 investors worldwide.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Braga created and controlled Trade Coin Club, a multi-level marketing program that operated from 2016 through 2018 and promised profits from the trading activities of a purported crypto asset trading bot. The SEC alleges that Braga and Paradise lured investors with false representations that the bot made \"millions of microtransactions\" every second, and that investors would receive minimum returns of 0.35 percent daily. However, instead of deploying investor funds for the purported trading bot, Braga allegedly siphoned off investor funds for his own benefit and to pay a network of worldwide Trade Coin Club promoters, including Paradise, Taylor, and Tetreault.\n\nThe SEC further alleges that Trade Coin Club operated as a Ponzi scheme and that investor withdrawals came entirely from deposits made by investors, not from any crypto asset trading activity by a bot or otherwise. The complaint further alleges that Braga personally received at least 8,396 bitcoin of the amounts invested (worth $55 million at the time), Paradise received 238 bitcoin (worth more than $1.4 million at the time), Taylor received 735 bitcoin (worth more than $2.6 million at the time), and Tetreault received 158 bitcoin (worth more than $625,000 at the time).\n\nThe SEC's complaint alleges that Braga violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act; Paradise violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act; and Taylor violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties. The SEC filed a second complaint alleging that Tetreault violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Tetreault agreed to settle the SEC's charges. The settlement is subject to Court approval.\n\nThe SEC's investigation was conducted by Serafima K. McTigue of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and Victor Hong of the San Francisco Regional Office. The case was supervised by Steven Buchholz, David Hirsch, and Jorge G. Tenreiro of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. The litigation is being conducted by John Han of the San Francisco Regional Office and Ms. McTigue.

Costello et al., No. 2:22-cv-01388 (W.D. Wash. Filed Sept. 29, 2022)\n\n\nOn October 31, 2022, Judge Ricardo S. Martinez of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a consent judgment against David Ferraro for his role in an alleged microcap stock promotion scheme that generated approximately $792,000 in trading profits for Ferraro and Justin Costello. As alleged in the SEC's complaint, this stock promotion scheme was part of a series of frauds that Costello perpetrated while falsely portraying himself to the public as a Harvard-educated military veteran and hedge fund billionaire.\n\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, from at least October 2019 through January 2021, Costello and Ferraro engaged in a stock promotion scheme in which Ferraro recommended and promoted to his Twitter followers and the public at least five microcap stocks that Costello owned, without disclosing that he and Costello intended to sell shares of those stocks as their prices rose, or that Costello would pay Ferraro a portion of his profits from some of those sales. Costello shared approximately $32,000 of his profits with Ferraro, and Ferraro profited approximately $41,000 from his own trading in this scheme. The SEC's complaint also alleges that Ferraro separately conducted his own stock promotion scheme respecting two additional microcap stocks, generating profits of approximately $68,000.\n\nThe SEC's complaint, filed on September 29, 2022, charges Ferraro with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Ferraro consented to a bifurcated settlement, agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions and from participating in any offering of a penny stock. Monetary relief will be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the Commission.\n\nThe SEC's litigation against Costello and Ferraro is being conducted by Pascale Guerrier, Samuel Kalar, and Tian Wen.

The SEC charged Harra and three other defendants in 2015 with fraud for their roles in Wilmington Trust's making of false or misleading public statements and omissions regarding its loan portfolio, including its underreporting, by hundreds of millions of dollars, of its real estate loans which were 90 days or more past due. The SEC's complaint, which was amended in March 2022, further alleged that Harra made false and misleading statements concerning the credit quality of certain of Wilmington Trust's loans.\n \n      Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Harra consented to the entry of a judgment that enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and further enjoins him from aiding and abetting future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-11 thereunder.
